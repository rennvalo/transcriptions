Joining me today are nomad food C. CEO stefan deschmaker and cfo ruben beldew. Now let's get. Started with our first question operator. We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press. Star then one on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, please. Pick up your handset before pressing the keys to withdraw your questions, please. Press star then too. At this time, you'll pause momentarily. To assemble our roster. The first question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks so much, and thanks again. To you guys for putting out the published, prepared remarks. That's actually very. Helpful to us in sort of getting through the results pretty quickly. Maybe Stefan, just as a starting point. I guess. What gives you the confidence and sort of the visibility? That you finally called the full year guidance low enough. Given the pattern more recently of missing and guiding. Lower over the past year. Thanks. Andrew, it's a great question, and obviously. It's. A very important question for us. Let me stand back for just. A second. I've been with the company for ten years, since we started. And quite frankly, to your point, I don't think we've been accustomed to this. So it's really something that we need to take into consideration. The guidance. The second point is. At the same time over the last ten years, with all the descriptions we've been through, I think. We've been very good at learning from. Od. Designs, so. Let me first start with what I think. Is self inflicted. And I'm really taking this on me, I think. We were too optimistic with OERP implement. Implementation. That's the first piece. And the second. Level. We also had an excessive venture in Q one. That, quite frankly. Within a poor job at anticipating it. And quite frankly, I'm taking these two points with me, I think. The lessons, though, is in terms of our Erp, we're slowing down. The program just to make sure that. We're taking the right. Level in terms of risk, digestion of all the things we're doing, which is absolutely. Fundamental, and I'm very pleased with what the team is doing at this stage. And in terms of. Excess inventory and all these. Things between selling and sellers. Quite frankly, what I've seen is the team is doing a much, much, much better job. At winning visibility between both. And let's say the dynamics between both, especially during these volatile times. So that's the first piece, which is really, quite frankly, I would call self inflicted. The second piece. Especially in Q two is the weather. Well. For information, June. In western Europe. Is one of the hottest. June in record. In the region. Some differences, obviously. Let's say nordics. Was a bit wider that you take countries like. France, like uk, like benjamin. While the numbers, especially between, let's say, mid June to mid J. July. Well, you have numbers around. Minus five. Minus six -7% for the market as such, where quite. Frankly, we would have expected to be in the region of 1.5 to. 2%. At the same time, we've been able to reg. Regain market to gain market share, especially in volume, which is. Good. And despite the fact that all categories are. Especially efficient and vegetables are under trading, especially. During the hot weather, but that's not obviously. So for us also, the learning here is okay. What can. We do to make sure that we have a better summer assortment. Because basically we don't know whether it's going to be a pattern for the future. But we need to be ready and to hedge our best for the future, for. 26 and beyond, and we have the teams up to pairing things. In terms of potatoes, in terms of. Let's say natural fish. And other things the data will mention later so as to make sure. That basically we have either, obviously, an additional opportunity for the future. Which we always did, and obviously also how to hedge. Our bet versus what can happen in the future. We don't know that. Piece. No. Obviously, with all these things and with all. These volatility. Yes. We have decided to take a wider range to take. Into account. Potential risk, obviously. Mostly around. Additional continuing heatwave. We haven't seen it yet. Let's say. Let's rate it when it's interesting to see. That first part of July was very hot, and we. 've seen the numbers immediately. In terms of sellout. And the second half was. Better. From our standpoint, obviously. Which means. Minor weather we've seen immediately. The correlation between the two, but this is why we. 're taking. This range, obviously. There is no additional. Heat wave or something similar. Obviously, we. 're not going to touch the low end. But that's why we took. A wider range, and I think it was not an easy decision. We in the standard, but at the same time, I definitely believe. It's the right decision. Thanks for that. Maybe. As a follow up. The midpoint of organic growth. Guidance for the year would point to about. 50 basis points of organic sales growth in the second half. If three q ultimately returns to some growth. As I think you hope it does. And that would suggest, I guess, not a whole lot. Of improvement between three q and four q am. I thinking about that the right way, or I would think maybe. Some of the sellout demand kind of build sequentially as you go through the. Year. But I'm just curious on your thoughts there. Thank you so much. Yeah, I think. Andrew, let me take that. So you're right. Also for the. Sake of the benefit. For the whole group. So our range between zero. And minus two sharings and h two between a plus two and. A half and a minus one and a half. And indeed, the midpoint is plus a half. You're right. Normally speaking, we should see growth in quantitative. But also to be clear, On what Stefan just said. And I know the optics of the weather, which is some data. Points. We've seen the market in quarter two in volume. Minus one with Easter, we expect that to be. Plus one. One half, including the easter side. We don't have all the. Sellout data yet for all markets, for the market for which we. Have it from mid June to mid July. We've seen. Market at minus five and a half, and we've seen that to establish point immed. Immediately reflected also in our sales, especially in northwest Europe, in big countries for us. Like UK. So that will have a track important. Fee. So we're not committing to growth in quarter three? Depends on what Steven. Just said, what are we seeing through the course of the quarter? Yes. And if there's no supported three year mathematics. Right. And the midpoint. It shoots a bit more prudent assumption for quarter four. We're also very conscious. That we've not lowered the guidance two times and we will avoid that happening again. Great. Thanks so much. Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche bank. Please. Go ahead. Great. Thank you very much. River just. To confirm. On your three q commentary. You are fully understand the marketplace trends into the quarter and the. Dynamics, but you are lapping. The ERP supply disruption of a year ago. I think that was about a two. And a half point negative to last year's. Sales versus consumption. Just want to clarify that. And make sure that. Comparison still factors into. Your outlook. Yeah, that's correct. So we indeed have. The year B lab, which was last year in August and September, and that was. Two and a half percent. It's also the numbers I just quoted. The two and half. On the top. End of the range and mine is one and a half on the botherment of the range. Actually underly. Underlying our big words. So you roughly talk about the top end around. One half at the bottom at around minus two and a half. So we'll have. That trade will comparison. Although again, I have to repeat that what we've seen in July so. Far was a weak start, especially in the UK. Okay, understood. Thank you. The broader question, maybe you could. Talk a little bit more about the inflationary pressures. You've seen build. Of late and how those. Are likely to flow. Through 25 and then carry over into 26. And I know it's very early, but just. Any kind of. Round numbers in terms of the magnitude of pricing that. You would be considering in 26 at this point, assuming the trends hold. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you for asking those questions. It's an important question. So we started the year and we said it goes off to court loan remarks. With an inflation assumption of around two and a half percent. We saw. That going into 4% last quarter and this quarter. We're looking at a full year inflation, around four and a half percent. The additional incre. Increase we've seen from four to four and a half is again an amoe optics but if you. Look at the weather. To Stefan's point, it has been the. Hottest summer in western Europe since ever. The last one was. 2003. It's not only the temperature, it's also. The dry. And the lack of rain. So Uk had seen. 70% more sunshine, which means we've had the worst crop for some long beach. And that is the main reason why our inflation assumption has moved from four to four and a half. Percent. That's also the main reason why you also see the gross margin drop. In quarter two. Now going forward, and as we said last time, We will take some price where we are able to do that. So, for example, We will take some price in the UK, but if you take a step back, we have here. The negotiation cycles, which are main in quarter one, and we don. 't see this as a reason to go off cycle. So a lot of the recovery. Of the inflation we have seen coming through in this year and before. We talked about chicken, and now we see some of the crops will have to be. Taken into pricing for next year, then your question is? Well, then, about next year, let's be clear. Our commitment. Now is. And our focus now is making sure we deliver our commit. Commitments for 2025, and we set the right foundation and fundame. Fundamentals for 2026. Yes, we will take pricing. To recover from 26. But there are also some other puts and takes. Like, for example, Some bonds. Releases which we had this year, which will be. A bit of a head in next year. Okay, thank you very much. I'll. Pass it on. Appreciate it. Our next question comes. From Scott Mark with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Hey. Good morning. Thanks so much for taking our questions. First thing I wanted to ask you about. You made some comments in the prepared remarks. Just about. Some of the SGNA savings and targeted overhead. Expense reductions. Maybe. Just wondering if you can kind of share. Any more details around some of those initiatives and how we should be thinking about. Those for the remainder of this year and then into next year. Yeah. Thank you. So we have to be seen. And you've seen. It also in the presentation reduction as TNA. Let's also be clear that. Is driven predominantly by over us. So not by amp but by overheads. Yes, there is an impact of some bonus releases, and I don't want to go into detail of how much it worked, but there's a substantial saving. Also because of our focus on cost competitive. Competitiveness and our focus on bringing indirect down after inflation. So compensating for INF. Inflation, and it also links to the previous question in terms of. Pricing and recovery. Yes, we will be taking pricing. But we're also conscious that we need to be costcompetitive and don't. Want to have. An overprice index versus our competition. So some of the saving. Savings. We have been driving, like, reductions in some of our support functions. Some synergies we saw and some go to market organization. Will continue into 26 as well. Understood. Thanks for that. Next. Question I wanted to ask about. Is just around some of the innovations. There were some commentary around. In 2024. I think you said about 10% of sales were from innovation and Re. Renovation this year. That's expected. To nearly double. Just wondering if you can kind of share some thoughts around the innovation, Pipel. Pipeline and kind of how you see that shaping up for the rest of this year as well. As next. Year. Thanks. And two points. Let me. Split it in between the two pieces. This year, obviously, is going to be higher. Than that, in combination of renovation and innovation, and both are equally important for us. Because renovation is absolutely fundamental in terms of. Making sure that we keep, we increase our security visa. Vo main competitors I. E. Private label, and that's a key piece. And we have a very aggressive program in terms of making sure that. Obviously, in terms. We will be superior or equal, but that will disappear. In terms of almost in battle. That's the first piece and. That program is well engaged. More to come, obviously, in the, coming in the. Coming quarters in terms of. Innovation, yes. The number little value is increasing. We win the region of now 6.5%. Which is a big difference compared to where we were in 22, 23. Which. Has gone down big time, especially during that time. Where price was the only thing that matters for the retailers and the consumers. And so in terms of innovation, well, you've seen that. There are cities of things that we're doing in terms of chicken, for example, in terms of. Fish. I mean, a lot of innovative innovation in terms of. Slacking, which is a new. Area for us, so we were very much. Focused on in terms of funny meal time, I think there is a great opportunity. For us in frozen food to go with snacking, and we're really. Starting this, especially in Italy with fish strips and. Other things like that. The same. The same way. So a lot of things, quite frankly. At this stage. Protein bowl is great as well. It's something that we're going to launch over the next few weeks in the UK Netherland. Netherlands, in Belgium. The countries are very excited by that. And then it's successful, and we think it's going to be successful. In the coming years because obviously also something been doing well. And better and better is the move from one country to another. Through. Leased and launch. It's successful in one country, obviously we can go. To other countries. So that program. Took a bit of time. I think it was a bit of. We were so focused on the mustard battle. That basically where alder rigor was not probably great in terms of Inno. Innovation. It has changed. It is changing. We have the machine battles. We have the growth. Platforms in the new countries, and it. 's making a difference. Understood. We'll pass it on. Thanks so much. Our. Next question comes from John Bombartner with Nizujo, please. Go ahead. Good morning. Thanks for the question. First off, Ruben just coming back. To the comments on productivity, I'm wondering if you can discuss some of. The newer initiatives. I think that this supply chain optimization program and. The facility closure in Sweden. Can you elaborate a bit on this plan? What else? Is involved in the program. And how should we think about the structural benefits? Yes. Thank you for asking that question. So. What we need now is a closure in the smaller factory. In the Nordics we've discussed in some older ones. And in other discussion. Forum, our overall network, and we actually. See a program on a couple of access. One is procurement, where. I think we've already made great steps, but there's more to come which we can also drive. In future years. And the second bit is on network, where. We have to look at our total complexity of our network, the number of sites as well within a site when we can do to optimize there. I've now been personally a year in a role, as you have also heard in our prepared remarks, together with Stefan, together with the whole executive chief supplier. We're embarking on the program to drive more cost compet. Competitors out of those programs, and we're keen to share more. With you in the second half of the year. Okay. And then coming back to innovation. Can you walk through? The future Foods lab you've established. What categories are you? Focus. Focusing on there. Do you plan on taking ownership interest in any of. The partners. Is it just more of a commercialization relationship? Just any more? Detail. That would be helpful. Thank you. Yeah. It's very interesting. It's obviously early in the game for risk, but. We indeed, we're learning. How to partner with. Actually, I went with that. Way, we were very much. Focused on ourselves. For many years, and I think we have evolved, and we're learning now how to deal. With. You guys. As a start. Startups. We have some more to come in. Food service probably in the coming months. We have a first example. I will explain the detail. This is because. It feels very highly confidential, but definitely it's the kind of things. We've learned a lot. With a startup, and we're going to start. With them in some countries where food service is present for us. That food service is big for us. In the. Southeast and Europe, in Switzerland, in the Nordics, and also. In Spain, Portugal. So we're going to start with that, with more to come in orders. But again, I don't want to die to come with a name right now, because. It's still confidential, but definitely it's going to come. In the coming months and the more to come up with others. We also did lopping, by the way, pilot plants, which also is going. To help us and our partners to move faster in terms of inno. Innovation. I think the speed at which innovation is taking place. Is absolutely. Critical. And with this kind of steps, we also can move faster and. Then, obviously. Closer to the market. But there will be other things. This portal is very interesting. We received a lot of attention from a lot of people. And now, in the process, obviously, Of selecting the guys with whom we want to work. But. It's very promising. Thank you. Again if you have. A question, please? Press star, then one. Our next question comes from. John tanwin tang with. Cj. CJF securities. Please go ahead. Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking. My questions. I was wondering if you could talk about the. Portfolio. And maybe this is a longer term question, just how you might be dealing with. Hot or hotter weather on average. Structurally. Versus the true outliers like you saw in Q two. We've. Seen more heat waves in recent years, and if that's something you need to prepare, For either in the portfolio. I don't know if it's moving ice cream out. Of the Adriatics. Or doing something with your crops and supply chain to position for. That just help us understand the long term positioning and how you might be dealing with that. If at all. Thank you. It's not only. How to move up to. The challenge we expect we experience this year. It's also the fact that. Year in, year out, even with, quote unquote, a normal weather. Structurally frozen food is lower in the. Server than in the spring or winter, obviously, or later the year. And then I think this combination of lower plus, obviously, the he. Heat wave is something that we want to tackle. I mean, more seriously. The difference compared to many years ago. When I think the teams at the time. Tried something. The opposite is so much wider that. We have chicken. We didn't have chicken in the bath. And chicken does very well, obviously. With barbecue marinated chicken, that kind of thing. That's one thing we also. Still have red meat, by the way, that we also can experience, I mean, much further. With our retailers. Let's say something like, Natural fish. Natural fish exist in many. They were very well. Developed in countries like Italy, for example. It's not. That blocked at all or not enough in a country like UK. Where it's mostly coated fish. Well, I can tell you when I went 30, Degrees. You don't necessarily want to eat a fish finger. Or fish stick. Well, golden, let's say. Marina. Marinaded fish or natural fish works very well. Potatoes in terms. Of to get together with. Barbecue is also something we developed. A lot. And I'm not even talking about the ice cream, which is something new. For us. We have, obviously, a very strong. Goal in the athletics with preserved acquisition. And Bosnia. And, well, a bite. Accidentally, somehow, like, you know, we started to develop something in aust. Austria, which is doing well because we had a very strong. People. In Vienna. We had a lot of people coming from Croatia, and it did well. So we're starting to. Develop these kind of things. Does that mean that we're going to do with ice cream? In orders. Not necessarily. But at least we have the assortment today that is available. And the first thing we're doing now is we're talking to other countries to see. What they see. And also, very importantly, we also starting. The conversation with the trade because it has to be incremental. And it can be incremental, and it requires also agility. How to move faster from one season to another. So a lot of things. A lot of opportunities, but definitely. Protest. Food can do well. With the hotter. With the summer and more specifically, Whether we need weight. Great. That's very helpful. Stefan. And then second, just any update on the capital allocation priorities? With the stock indicating down you've done repurchases. Or maybe there's a preference. For debut payment. Any thoughts there? Yes. So thank you for that. We have done quite a bit of share. Buybacks in h one on the main earth versus the year before, less than 20 million. We just announced the dividends, so I think from kind of capitalocation we've done. A lot in buybacks and with dividend. We want to keep our flexibility. Plus, we've shown to be. A good MNA and quiet being able to acquire good companies. But at this moment, With our current valuation. Also, what's out there in the market? It's not that. Any short term. There's an MNA pipeline where we're now committing to buyback that also depends. On our overall flexibility. Great. Thank you. This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over. To Stefan decisionmaker for any closing remarks. Thank you, Ranger. So. While I'm disappointed by your first half performance, I remember. Not less confident in the future that lies ahead of us. We have a great vote for you. We have a strategy. That is working, and we have a talented team of people, well equipped. With the level of plans we had in front of us. We. Have successfully stabilized our market share and have compelling plans to increase. Our competitiveness in the back half of the year. We are well, position. Positioned to delivering accelerating growth. When disruption subsides. I look forward to Demonstra. Demonstrating that with results when we update you again next quarter. Thank you for your time and interest in nomad foods. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Given the pattern more recently of missing and guiding lower over the past Year."},{"end_time":"326870","segment_id":6,"speaker":"Stephane Deshmaker","start_time":"206360","text":"Thanks, Andrew. It's a great question and obviously it's a very important question for us. And let me stand back for just a second. I've been with the company for 10 years since we started and quite frankly to your point, I don't think we've been accustomed to this. So it's really something that we need to take into consideration the guidance. The second point is at the same time over the last 10 years, with all the disruptions we've been through, I think we've been very good at learning from all these events. So let me first start with what I think is self inflicted and I'm really taking this on me. I think we were too optimistic with our ERP implementation. That's the first piece. And the second level, we also had an excessive inventory in Q1 that quite frankly we did a poor job at anticipating it. And quite frankly I'm taking these two points with me. I think the lessons though is in terms of our erp, we're slowing down the program just to make sure that we're taking the right level in terms of risk digestion of all the things we're doing, which is absolutely fundamental. And I'm very pleased with what the team is doing at this stage. And in terms of excess inventory and all these things between selling and sell out, quite frankly what I've seen is the team is doing a much, much, much better job at reading the visibility between both and let's say the dynamics between both, especially during these volatile times. So that's the first piece which is really, quite frankly I would call self inflicted. The second piece, especially in Q2 is the weather. Well, for information, June in Western Europe was the hottest June in record in the region. Some differences obviously Nordics was different."},{"end_time":"328970","segment_id":7,"speaker":"UNKNOWN","start_time":"328690","text":"But you know,"},{"end_time":"471780","segment_id":8,"speaker":"Stephane Deshmaker","start_time":"328970","text":"Take countries like France, like uk, like Belgium. Well, the numbers, you know, especially between, let's say mid June to mid July, well, you have numbers around, you know, minus 5, minus 6, minus 7% for the market as such, where quite frankly we would have expected to be in the region of 1.5 to 2% at the same time we've been able to regain market to gain market share, especially in volume, which is good. And despite the fact that our categories are especially fish and vegetables are under trading, especially during the hot weather. But that's not obviously not enough. So for us also the learning here is okay, what can we do to make sure that we have a better summer assortment? Because basically we don't know whether, you know, it's going to be a pattern for the future. But we need to be ready and to hedge our bet for the future for 20, 26 and beyond. And we have, you know, the teams are preparing things in terms of potatoes, in terms of, let's say natural fish and other things that we mentioned later so as to make sure that basically we have either, you know, obviously an additional opportunity for the future, which we always did, and obviously also how to hedge our bet versus what can happen in the future. We don't know that piece. Now, obviously with all these things and with all this volatility. Yes, we have decided to take a wider range to take into account potential risk, obviously mostly around additional continuing heat wave. We haven't seen it yet, let's say, let's face it when it's interesting to see that first part of July was very hot and we've seen the numbers immediately in terms of sellout. And the second half was better, was better from our standpoint, obviously, which means milder weather. And we've seen immediately the correlation between the two. But this is why we're taking this range. Obviously there is no additional heat wave or something similar. Obviously we're not going to touch the low end, but that's why we took a wider range. And I think it was not an easy decision. We understand that, but at the same time I definitely believe it's the right decision."},{"end_time":"510670","segment_id":9,"speaker":"Andrew Lazar","start_time":"473540","text":"Thanks for that. Then maybe as a follow up, the midpoint of organic growth guidance for the year would point to about 50 basis points of organic sales growth in the second half. If 3Q ultimately returns to some growth, as I think you hope it does, that would suggest, I guess not a whole lot of improvement between 3Q and 4Q. Am I thinking about that the right way or. I would think maybe some of the sellout demand kind of builds sequentially as you go through the year. But I'm just curious on your thoughts there. Thank you so much."},{"end_time":"537990","segment_id":10,"speaker":"Reuben Baldu","start_time":"511960","text":"Yeah, thanks Andrew. Let me take that. So you're right. Let me also for the sake of the benefit for the whole group. So our range between 0 and minus 2 assumes an H2 between a plus 2 and a half and a minus 1.5 and indeed the midpoint is plus a half. You're right that normally speaking we should see growth in quarter three, but also to be clear on what Stefan just said, and I know the optics of the weather, but just some data points, we've seen the market in, in quarter."},{"end_time":"541350","segment_id":11,"speaker":"Reuben Baldu","start_time":"537990","text":"2 in volume, minus 1% with Easter."},{"end_time":"550910","segment_id":12,"speaker":"Reuben Baldu","start_time":"541350","text":"We expect that to be plus 1.1.5, including the Easter, we don't have all the sellout data yet for all markets.

Depends on what Stefan just said. What are we seeing through the course of the quarter? Yes. And if there's going to be quarter three, your mathematics are right.

We're also very conscious that we've now lowered the guidance two times and we won't avoid that happening again."},{"end_time":"589620","segment_id":17,"speaker":"Andrew Lazar","start_time":"588820","text":"Thanks so much."},{"end_time":"595950","segment_id":18,"speaker":"OPERATOR","start_time":"592110","text":"Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead."},{"end_time":"631990","segment_id":19,"speaker":"Steve Powers","start_time":"598190","text":"Great. Thank you very much, Ruben. Just to confirm on your 3Q commentary, you fully understand the marketplace trends into the quarter and the dynamics, but you are lapping the ERP supply disruption of a year ago. I think that was about a two and a half point negative to last year's sales versus consumption. Just want to clarify that and make sure that that comparison still factors into your outlook."},{"end_time":"661680","segment_id":20,"speaker":"Reuben Baldu","start_time":"632790","text":"Yeah, that's correct. So we indeed have the ERP lag, which was last year in August and September, and that was 2.5%. So also the numbers I just quoted, the two and a half on the top end of the range and the minus 1.5% on the bottom end of the range actually underlying are a bit worse. So you roughly talk about the top end is around 1.5 and the bottom end around minus 2 and a half. So we'll have that favorable comparison, although again, I have to repeat that what we've seen in July so far was a weak start, especially in the uk."},{"end_time":"691660","segment_id":21,"speaker":"Steve Powers","start_time":"662240","text":"Okay, understood. Thank you. The broader question, maybe you could talk a little bit more about the inflationary pressures you've seen build of late and how those are likely to flow through 25 and then carry over into 26. And I know it's very early, but just any kind of round numbers in terms of the magnitude of pricing that you would be considering in 26 at this point, assuming that the trends hold. Thank you."},{"end_time":"749650","segment_id":22,"speaker":"Reuben Baldu","start_time":"691740","text":"Yeah, thank you for asking that question. It's an important question. So we started the year and we set it Also after quarter one remarks, we with an inflation assumption of around 2.5%. We saw that going into 4% last quarter and this quarter we're looking At a full year inflation of around 4.5%, the additional increase we've seen from 4 to 4.5 is again and I know the upticks, but if you look at the weather, to Stefan's point, it has been the hottest summer in Western Europe since ever. The Last one was 2003. It's not only the temperature, it's also the dryness and the lack of rain. So UK had seen 70% more sunshine, which means we've had the worst crop for some one piece. And that is the main reason why our inflation assumption has moved from 4 to 4.5%. That's also the main reason why you also see the gross margin drop in quarter two now going forward. And as we said last time, we will take some price where we are."},{"end_time":"750490","segment_id":23,"speaker":"Reuben Baldu","start_time":"749650","text":"Able to do that."},{"end_time":"800530","segment_id":24,"speaker":"Reuben Baldu","start_time":"750570","text":"So for example, we will take some price in the uk, but if you take a step back, we have yearly negotiation cycles which are mainly quarter one and we don't see this as a reason to go up cycle. So a lot of the recovery of the inflation we have seen coming through in this year and before we talked about chicken and now we see some of the crops will have to be taken into pricing for next year. Then your question is what then about next year? Let's be clear. Our commitment now and our focus now is making sure we deliver our commitments for 2025 and we set the foundation and fundament for 2026. Yes, we will take pricing to recover in 26, but there are also some other puts and takes like for example, also some bonus releases which we had this year which will be a bit of a headwind next year."},{"end_time":"804530","segment_id":25,"speaker":"Steve Powers","start_time":"801730","text":"Okay, thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Appreciate it."},{"end_time":"810130","segment_id":26,"speaker":"OPERATOR","start_time":"806290","text":"Our next question comes from Scott Mark with Jefferies. Please go ahead."},{"end_time":"834300","segment_id":27,"speaker":"Scott Mark","start_time":"812220","text":"Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking our questions. First thing I wanted to ask about, you made some comments in the prepared remarks just about some of the SGA savings and targeted overhead expense reductions maybe just wondering if you can kind of share any more details around some of those initiatives and how we should be thinking about those for the remainder of this year and then into next year."},{"end_time":"889540","segment_id":28,"speaker":"Reuben Baldu","start_time":"835660","text":"Yeah, thank you. So we have indeed seen and you've seen it also in the presentation reduction sgna. Let's also be clear that is driven predominantly by overheads. So not by amv, but by overheads. Yes, there is an impact of some bonus releases and I don't want to go into detail of how much is what, but there's a substantial saving also because of our focus on cost. Competitiveness and our focus on bringing indirects down after inflation. So compensating for inflation. And it also links to the previous question in terms of pricing recovery. Yes, we will be taking pricing. We're also conscious that we need to be cost competitive and don't want to have an over price index versus our competition. So some of the savings we have been driving, like reductions in some of our support functions, some synergies we saw in some go to market organization will continue into 26 as well."},{"end_time":"920290","segment_id":29,"speaker":"Scott Mark","start_time":"892740","text":"Understood. Thanks for that. Next question I wanted to ask about is just around some of the innovations there was some commentary around, you know, in 2024, I think you said about 10% of sales were from innovation and renovation. This year that's expected to nearly double. Just wondering if you can kind of share some thoughts around the innovation pipeline and kind of how you see that shaping up for the rest of this year as well as next year. Thanks."},{"end_time":"1059960","segment_id":30,"speaker":"Stephane Deshmaker","start_time":"921250","text":"Well, to your point, let me split it in between two pieces. This year obviously is going to be higher than that in combination of renovation and innovation. And both are equally important for us because renovation is absolutely fundamental in terms of making sure that we keep we increase our security vis a vis our main competitors. That is private label and that's a key piece. And we have a very, very aggressive program in terms of making sure that obviously in terms we will be superior or equal, but definitely superior in terms of our main battles. That's the first piece. And that program is well engaged. More to come obviously in the coming quarters. In terms of innovation, yes, the number little by little is increasing. We now have 6.5% which is a big difference compared to where we were in 22, 23, which had gone down big time, especially during that time where price was the only thing that mattered for the retailers and the consumers. And so in terms of innovation, well, you've seen a series of things that we're doing in terms of chicken, for example, in terms of fish, I mean a lot of inovino innovation in terms of snacking, which is a new area for us. So we were very much focused on in terms of family mealtime. I think there is a great opportunity for us in frozen food to go with snacking. And we're really starting this especially in Italy with fish strips and other things like that the same way. So a lot of things, you know, quite frankly at this stage, protein bowl is great as well. It's something that we're going to launch now in the next few weeks in the uk, in Netherlands, in Belgium, the countries are very excited by that. And then it's successful. And we think it's going to be successful. Obviously more to come in the coming years because obviously also something we're doing well and better and better is the move from one country to another through a list and launch. It's successful in one country, obviously we can go to other countries. So the program, you know, I mean, took a bit of time. I think it was a bit of. We were so focused on the Muslim battle that basically the rigor was not probably great in terms of innovation. It has changed, it is changing. We have the Muslim battles, we have the growth, the growth platforms in the new countries and that it's making a difference."},{"end_time":"1064760","segment_id":31,"speaker":"Scott Mark","start_time":"1062680","text":"Understood.

Please go ahead."},{"end_time":"1094760","segment_id":33,"speaker":"John Baumgartner","start_time":"1073640","text":"Good morning. Thanks for the question. First off, Ruben, just coming back to the comments on productivity. I'm wondering if you can discuss some of the newer initiatives. I think that this supply chain optimization program and the facility closure in Sweden. Can you elaborate a bit on this plan? What else is involved in the program and how should we think about the structural benefits?"},{"end_time":"1149630","segment_id":34,"speaker":"Reuben Baldu","start_time":"1096330","text":"Yes, thank you for asking that question. So what we need announced is a closure in a smaller factory in the Nordics. We've discussed some one on ones. In another discussion for our overall network, we actually see a program on a couple of axes. One is procurement, where I think we've already made great steps, but there's more to come which we can also drive in future years. And the second bit is on network, where we have to look at our total complexity of our network, the number of sites as well within a site, what we can do to optimize there. I've now been personally a year in the role, as you have also heard in our prepared remarks, together with Stefan, together with our whole exec, with our chief supply chain officer, we're embarking on a program to drive more cost competitive out of those programs. And we're keen to share more with you in the second half of the year."},{"end_time":"1168830","segment_id":35,"speaker":"John Baumgartner","start_time":"1151470","text":"Okay. And then coming back to innovation, can you, can you walk through the Future Foods lab you've established? You know, what categories are you focusing on there? Do you plan on taking ownership interests in any of the partners? Is it just more of a commercialization relationship? Just, you know, any. Any more detail? That would be helpful, thank you."},{"end_time":"1268810","segment_id":36,"speaker":"Stephane Deshmaker","start_time":"1169390","text":"Yeah, it's very interesting. It's obviously early in the game for us, but indeed we're learning how to partner with. Actually, I would put it that way. We were very much focused on ourselves for many years and I think we have evolved and we're learning now how to deal with new guys at the startups. We have some more to come in food service probably in the coming months. We have a first example. I will spare you the detail of this because it feels very, very highly confidential. But definitely it's the kind of things we've learned a lot with the startup and we're going to start with them in some countries where food service is present for us. You know that food service is big for us in southeastern Europe, in Switzerland, in the Nordics and also in Spain, Portugal. So we're going to start with that, but more to come in orders. But again, I don't want to come with a name right now because it's not, you know, it's still confidential but definitely going to come in the coming months. And the more to come with others, we also developing, by the way, pilot plants which also is going to help us and our partners to move faster in terms of innovation. I think the speed at which innovation is taking place is absolutely critical. And with this kind of steps we also can move faster and then be closer to the market. But there will be other things. You know, this portal is very interesting. We received a lot of attention from a lot of people and now in the process obviously of selecting the guys with whom we want to work. But it's very promising."},{"end_time":"1271770","segment_id":37,"speaker":"John Baumgartner","start_time":"1271210","text":"Thank you."},{"end_time":"1284860","segment_id":38,"speaker":"OPERATOR","start_time":"1274250","text":"Again.

Please go ahead."},{"end_time":"1320620","segment_id":39,"speaker":"John Tanwen Tang","start_time":"1285980","text":"Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could talk about the portfolio and maybe this is a longer term question just how you might be dealing with hotter weather. Hotter weather on average structurally versus, you know, the true outliers like you saw in Q2. You know, we've seen more heat waves in recent years and if that's something you need to prepare for, you know, either in the portfolio, I don't know if it's moving ice cream out of the Adriatics or doing something, you know, with your crops and supply chain to, you know, position for that, just help us understand the long term positioning and how you might be dealing with that, if at all."},{"end_time":"1480840","segment_id":40,"speaker":"Stephane Deshmaker","start_time":"1320620","text":"Thank you. You know, John, I think it's not only, you know, how to move up to the challenge we expect we experience this year, it's also the fact that year in, year out, even with quote unquote, the normal weather, structurally frozen food is lower in the Summer than in the spring or winter, obviously, or later in the year. And then I think this combination of lower plus obviously the heat wave is something that we want to tackle. I mean, more seriously the difference compared to many years ago when I think the teams at a time tried something. We have, I mean, the opportunity is so much wider that, you know, we have, we have chicken, we didn't have chicken in the past. And chicken does very well, obviously with barbecues, marinated chicken, that kind of thing. That's one thing. We also still have red meat, by the way, that we also can experience much further with our retailers. Let's say something like natural fish. Natural fish exist in many very well developed in countries like Italy, for example. It's not deadlock the door or not enough, you know, in country, in a country like uk where it's mostly coated fish, well, you know, I can tell you when it's 30 degrees, you know, you don't necessarily want to eat a fish finger or fish stick. Well coated, let's say marinated fish or natural fish works very well. Potatoes, in terms of, you know, to get together with barbecue is also something we develop a lot. And I'm not even talking about, you know, the ice cream, which is something new for us. We have obviously a very strong goal in the Adriatics with Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia. And well, a bit accidentally, somehow we started to develop something in Austria, which is doing well because we had very strong, let's say strong people in Vienna. We had a lot of people coming from Croatia and it did well. So we're starting to develop these kind of things. Does that mean that we're going to do with ice cream in order? Not necessarily, but at least we have the assortment today that is available. And the first thing we're doing now is we're talking to other countries to see what they see. And also, very importantly, we're also starting the conversation with the trip because it has to be incremental and it can be incremental, but it requires also agility, how to move faster from one season to another. So a lot of things, a lot of opportunities.

At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Jason English, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may now begin. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. I hope everyone has had the chance to read our press release and listen to our prerecorded management remarks, both of which are available on our website. In addition, we have posted a transcript of the prerecorded remarks and the accompanying presentation. At the conclusion of today's live Q and A session, we'll also post an audio replay of this call. Please note that during today's Q and A session we may make forward looking statements that are based on our view of the company's prospects, expectations and intentions. At this time, actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties which are discussed in our press release, our filings with the SEC and in our investor presentation which includes cautionary language. We will also discuss non IFRS financial measures during the call today. These non IFRS financial measures should not be considered replacement for and should be read together with IFRS results. Users can find the IFRS to non IFRS reconciliations within our earnings release and the appendices at the end of the slide presentation available on our website. Please note that certain financial information within this presentation represents adjusted figures. All adjusted figures have been adjusted primarily for, when applicable, share based payment expenses and related employer payroll taxes, exceptional items and foreign currency translation charges or gains. Unless otherwise noted, comments from here will refer to those adjusted numbers. Joining me today are Nomad Foods CEO Stephane Deshmaker and CFO Reuben Baldu. Now let's get started with our first question operator. We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press Star then one on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press Star then two. At this time we'll pause momentarily to assemble our roster. The first question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks so much and thanks again to you guys for putting out the published prepared remarks. That's actually very helpful to us in sort of getting through the results pretty quickly. Maybe Stephan, just as a starting point, I guess what gives you the confidence and sort of the visibility that you finally called the full year guidance low enough? Given the pattern more recently of missing and guiding lower over the past Year. Thanks, Andrew. It's a great question and obviously it's a very important question for us. And let me stand back for just a second. I've been with the company for 10 years since we started and quite frankly to your point, I don't think we've been accustomed to this. So it's really something that we need to take into consideration the guidance. The second point is at the same time over the last 10 years, with all the disruptions we've been through, I think we've been very good at learning from all these events. So let me first start with what I think is self inflicted and I'm really taking this on me. I think we were too optimistic with our ERP implementation. That's the first piece. And the second level, we also had an excessive inventory in Q1 that quite frankly we did a poor job at anticipating it. And quite frankly I'm taking these two points with me. I think the lessons though is in terms of our erp, we're slowing down the program just to make sure that we're taking the right level in terms of risk digestion of all the things we're doing, which is absolutely fundamental. And I'm very pleased with what the team is doing at this stage. And in terms of excess inventory and all these things between selling and sell out, quite frankly what I've seen is the team is doing a much, much, much better job at reading the visibility between both and let's say the dynamics between both, especially during these volatile times. So that's the first piece which is really, quite frankly I would call self inflicted. The second piece, especially in Q2 is the weather. Well, for information, June in Western Europe was the hottest June in record in the region. Some differences obviously Nordics was different. But you know, Take countries like France, like uk, like Belgium. Well, the numbers, you know, especially between, let's say mid June to mid July, well, you have numbers around, you know, minus 5, minus 6, minus 7% for the market as such, where quite frankly we would have expected to be in the region of 1.5 to 2% at the same time we've been able to regain market to gain market share, especially in volume, which is good. And despite the fact that our categories are especially fish and vegetables are under trading, especially during the hot weather. But that's not obviously not enough. So for us also the learning here is okay, what can we do to make sure that we have a better summer assortment? Because basically we don't know whether, you know, it's going to be a pattern for the future. But we need to be ready and to hedge our bet for the future for 20, 26 and beyond. And we have, you know, the teams are preparing things in terms of potatoes, in terms of, let's say natural fish and other things that we mentioned later so as to make sure that basically we have either, you know, obviously an additional opportunity for the future, which we always did, and obviously also how to hedge our bet versus what can happen in the future. We don't know that piece. Now, obviously with all these things and with all this volatility. Yes, we have decided to take a wider range to take into account potential risk, obviously mostly around additional continuing heat wave. We haven't seen it yet, let's say, let's face it when it's interesting to see that first part of July was very hot and we've seen the numbers immediately in terms of sellout. And the second half was better, was better from our standpoint, obviously, which means milder weather. And we've seen immediately the correlation between the two. But this is why we're taking this range. Obviously there is no additional heat wave or something similar. Obviously we're not going to touch the low end, but that's why we took a wider range. And I think it was not an easy decision. We understand that, but at the same time I definitely believe it's the right decision. Thanks for that. Then maybe as a follow up, the midpoint of organic growth guidance for the year would point to about 50 basis points of organic sales growth in the second half. If 3Q ultimately returns to some growth, as I think you hope it does, that would suggest, I guess not a whole lot of improvement between 3Q and 4Q. Am I thinking about that the right way or. I would think maybe some of the sellout demand kind of builds sequentially as you go through the year. But I'm just curious on your thoughts there. Thank you so much. Yeah, thanks Andrew. Let me take that. So you're right. Let me also for the sake of the benefit for the whole group. So our range between 0 and minus 2 assumes an H2 between a plus 2 and a half and a minus 1.5 and indeed the midpoint is plus a half. You're right that normally speaking we should see growth in quarter three, but also to be clear on what Stefan just said, and I know the optics of the weather, but just some data points, we've seen the market in, in quarter. 2 in volume, minus 1% with Easter. We expect that to be plus 1.1.5, including the Easter, we don't have all the sellout data yet for all markets. But for the market for which we. Have it, from mid June to mid. July, we've seen market at -5 and a half. And we've seen that, to Stephan's point, immediately reflected also in our sales, especially in northwest Europe, in big countries for us like uk. So that will have a drag on quarter three. So we're not committing to growth in quarter three. Depends on what Stefan just said. What are we seeing through the course of the quarter? Yes. And if there's going to be quarter three, your mathematics are right. And the midpoint assumes a bit more of a prudent assumption for quarter four. We're also very conscious that we've now lowered the guidance two times and we won't avoid that happening again. Thanks so much. Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you very much, Ruben. Just to confirm on your 3Q commentary, you fully understand the marketplace trends into the quarter and the dynamics, but you are lapping the ERP supply disruption of a year ago. I think that was about a two and a half point negative to last year's sales versus consumption. Just want to clarify that and make sure that that comparison still factors into your outlook. Yeah, that's correct. So we indeed have the ERP lag, which was last year in August and September, and that was 2.5%. So also the numbers I just quoted, the two and a half on the top end of the range and the minus 1.5% on the bottom end of the range actually underlying are a bit worse. So you roughly talk about the top end is around 1.5 and the bottom end around minus 2 and a half. So we'll have that favorable comparison, although again, I have to repeat that what we've seen in July so far was a weak start, especially in the uk. Okay, understood. Thank you. The broader question, maybe you could talk a little bit more about the inflationary pressures you've seen build of late and how those are likely to flow through 25 and then carry over into 26. And I know it's very early, but just any kind of round numbers in terms of the magnitude of pricing that you would be considering in 26 at this point, assuming that the trends hold. Thank you. Yeah, thank you for asking that question. It's an important question. So we started the year and we set it Also after quarter one remarks, we with an inflation assumption of around 2.5%. We saw that going into 4% last quarter and this quarter we're looking At a full year inflation of around 4.5%, the additional increase we've seen from 4 to 4.5 is again and I know the upticks, but if you look at the weather, to Stefan's point, it has been the hottest summer in Western Europe since ever. The Last one was 2003. It's not only the temperature, it's also the dryness and the lack of rain. So UK had seen 70% more sunshine, which means we've had the worst crop for some one piece. And that is the main reason why our inflation assumption has moved from 4 to 4.5%. That's also the main reason why you also see the gross margin drop in quarter two now going forward. And as we said last time, we will take some price where we are. Able to do that. So for example, we will take some price in the uk, but if you take a step back, we have yearly negotiation cycles which are mainly quarter one and we don't see this as a reason to go up cycle. So a lot of the recovery of the inflation we have seen coming through in this year and before we talked about chicken and now we see some of the crops will have to be taken into pricing for next year. Then your question is what then about next year? Let's be clear. Our commitment now and our focus now is making sure we deliver our commitments for 2025 and we set the foundation and fundament for 2026. Yes, we will take pricing to recover in 26, but there are also some other puts and takes like for example, also some bonus releases which we had this year which will be a bit of a headwind next year. Okay, thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Appreciate it. Our next question comes from Scott Mark with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking our questions. First thing I wanted to ask about, you made some comments in the prepared remarks just about some of the SGA savings and targeted overhead expense reductions maybe just wondering if you can kind of share any more details around some of those initiatives and how we should be thinking about those for the remainder of this year and then into next year. Yeah, thank you. So we have indeed seen and you've seen it also in the presentation reduction sgna. Let's also be clear that is driven predominantly by overheads. So not by amv, but by overheads. Yes, there is an impact of some bonus releases and I don't want to go into detail of how much is what, but there's a substantial saving also because of our focus on cost. Competitiveness and our focus on bringing indirects down after inflation. So compensating for inflation. And it also links to the previous question in terms of pricing recovery. Yes, we will be taking pricing. We're also conscious that we need to be cost competitive and don't want to have an over price index versus our competition. So some of the savings we have been driving, like reductions in some of our support functions, some synergies we saw in some go to market organization will continue into 26 as well. Understood. Thanks for that. Next question I wanted to ask about is just around some of the innovations there was some commentary around, you know, in 2024, I think you said about 10% of sales were from innovation and renovation. This year that's expected to nearly double. Just wondering if you can kind of share some thoughts around the innovation pipeline and kind of how you see that shaping up for the rest of this year as well as next year. Thanks. Well, to your point, let me split it in between two pieces. This year obviously is going to be higher than that in combination of renovation and innovation. And both are equally important for us because renovation is absolutely fundamental in terms of making sure that we keep we increase our security vis a vis our main competitors. That is private label and that's a key piece. And we have a very, very aggressive program in terms of making sure that obviously in terms we will be superior or equal, but definitely superior in terms of our main battles. That's the first piece. And that program is well engaged. More to come obviously in the coming quarters. In terms of innovation, yes, the number little by little is increasing. We now have 6.5% which is a big difference compared to where we were in 22, 23, which had gone down big time, especially during that time where price was the only thing that mattered for the retailers and the consumers. And so in terms of innovation, well, you've seen a series of things that we're doing in terms of chicken, for example, in terms of fish, I mean a lot of inovino innovation in terms of snacking, which is a new area for us. So we were very much focused on in terms of family mealtime. I think there is a great opportunity for us in frozen food to go with snacking. And we're really starting this especially in Italy with fish strips and other things like that the same way. So a lot of things, you know, quite frankly at this stage, protein bowl is great as well. It's something that we're going to launch now in the next few weeks in the uk, in Netherlands, in Belgium, the countries are very excited by that. And then it's successful. And we think it's going to be successful. Obviously more to come in the coming years because obviously also something we're doing well and better and better is the move from one country to another through a list and launch. It's successful in one country, obviously we can go to other countries. So the program, you know, I mean, took a bit of time. I think it was a bit of. We were so focused on the Muslim battle that basically the rigor was not probably great in terms of innovation. It has changed, it is changing. We have the Muslim battles, we have the growth, the growth platforms in the new countries and that it's making a difference. Understood. We'll pass it on. Thanks so much. Our next question comes from John Baumgartner with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Good morning. Thanks for the question. First off, Ruben, just coming back to the comments on productivity. I'm wondering if you can discuss some of the newer initiatives. I think that this supply chain optimization program and the facility closure in Sweden. Can you elaborate a bit on this plan? What else is involved in the program and how should we think about the structural benefits? Yes, thank you for asking that question. So what we need announced is a closure in a smaller factory in the Nordics. We've discussed some one on ones. In another discussion for our overall network, we actually see a program on a couple of axes. One is procurement, where I think we've already made great steps, but there's more to come which we can also drive in future years. And the second bit is on network, where we have to look at our total complexity of our network, the number of sites as well within a site, what we can do to optimize there. I've now been personally a year in the role, as you have also heard in our prepared remarks, together with Stefan, together with our whole exec, with our chief supply chain officer, we're embarking on a program to drive more cost competitive out of those programs. And we're keen to share more with you in the second half of the year. Okay. And then coming back to innovation, can you, can you walk through the Future Foods lab you've established? You know, what categories are you focusing on there? Do you plan on taking ownership interests in any of the partners? Is it just more of a commercialization relationship? Just, you know, any. Any more detail? That would be helpful, thank you. Yeah, it's very interesting. It's obviously early in the game for us, but indeed we're learning how to partner with. Actually, I would put it that way. We were very much focused on ourselves for many years and I think we have evolved and we're learning now how to deal with new guys at the startups. We have some more to come in food service probably in the coming months. We have a first example. I will spare you the detail of this because it feels very, very highly confidential. But definitely it's the kind of things we've learned a lot with the startup and we're going to start with them in some countries where food service is present for us. You know that food service is big for us in southeastern Europe, in Switzerland, in the Nordics and also in Spain, Portugal. So we're going to start with that, but more to come in orders. But again, I don't want to come with a name right now because it's not, you know, it's still confidential but definitely going to come in the coming months. And the more to come with others, we also developing, by the way, pilot plants which also is going to help us and our partners to move faster in terms of innovation. I think the speed at which innovation is taking place is absolutely critical. And with this kind of steps we also can move faster and then be closer to the market. But there will be other things. You know, this portal is very interesting. We received a lot of attention from a lot of people and now in the process obviously of selecting the guys with whom we want to work. But it's very promising. Thank you. Again. If you have a question, please press star then one. Our next question comes from John Tanwen Tang with CJS Securities. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could talk about the portfolio and maybe this is a longer term question just how you might be dealing with hotter weather. Hotter weather on average structurally versus, you know, the true outliers like you saw in Q2. You know, we've seen more heat waves in recent years and if that's something you need to prepare for, you know, either in the portfolio, I don't know if it's moving ice cream out of the Adriatics or doing something, you know, with your crops and supply chain to, you know, position for that, just help us understand the long term positioning and how you might be dealing with that, if at all. Thank you. You know, John, I think it's not only, you know, how to move up to the challenge we expect we experience this year, it's also the fact that year in, year out, even with quote unquote, the normal weather, structurally frozen food is lower in the Summer than in the spring or winter, obviously, or later in the year. And then I think this combination of lower plus obviously the heat wave is something that we want to tackle. I mean, more seriously the difference compared to many years ago when I think the teams at a time tried something. We have, I mean, the opportunity is so much wider that, you know, we have, we have chicken, we didn't have chicken in the past. And chicken does very well, obviously with barbecues, marinated chicken, that kind of thing. That's one thing. We also still have red meat, by the way, that we also can experience much further with our retailers. Let's say something like natural fish. Natural fish exist in many very well developed in countries like Italy, for example. It's not deadlock the door or not enough, you know, in country, in a country like uk where it's mostly coated fish, well, you know, I can tell you when it's 30 degrees, you know, you don't necessarily want to eat a fish finger or fish stick. Well coated, let's say marinated fish or natural fish works very well. Potatoes, in terms of, you know, to get together with barbecue is also something we develop a lot. And I'm not even talking about, you know, the ice cream, which is something new for us. We have obviously a very strong goal in the Adriatics with Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia. And well, a bit accidentally, somehow we started to develop something in Austria, which is doing well because we had very strong, let's say strong people in Vienna. We had a lot of people coming from Croatia and it did well. So we're starting to develop these kind of things. Does that mean that we're going to do with ice cream in order? Not necessarily, but at least we have the assortment today that is available. And the first thing we're doing now is we're talking to other countries to see what they see. And also, very importantly, we're also starting the conversation with the trip because it has to be incremental and it can be incremental, but it requires also agility, how to move faster from one season to another. So a lot of things, a lot of opportunities. But definitely frozen food can do well with the hotter weather, with the summer and more specifically with the wind, heat waves. Great, that's very helpful, Stephane. And then second, just any update on the capital allocation priorities with the stock indicating down you've done repurchases or maybe there's a preference for debt repayment here. Any thoughts there? Yes. So thank you for that. We have done quite a bit of share buybacks in H100 million euros versus the year before for less than 20 million. We just announced a dividend. So I think from kind of capital allocation, we've done a lot with buybacks and with the dividend, you know, we want to keep our flexibility. In the past, we've shown to be a good M and A and being able to acquire good companies. But at this moment, with our current valuation also what's out there in the market, it's not that in the short term there's an M and A pipeline. Whether we're now committing to buyback, that also depends a bit on our overall flexibility. Great. Thank you. This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Stephane Deshmaker for any closing remarks. Thank you, Operator. So while I'm disappointed by your first half performance, I remain nonetheless confident in the future that lies ahead of us. We have a great portfolio, we have a strategy that is working and we have a talented team of people well equipped to deliver the plans we have in front of us. We have successfully stabilized our market share and have compelling plans to increase our competitiveness in the back half of the year. We are well positioned to delivering accelerating growth when weather disruption subsides. I look forward to demonstrating that with results when we update you again next quarter.

And the second half was better, was better from our standpoint, obviously, which means milder weather. And we've seen immediately the correlation between the two. But this is why we're taking this range. Obviously there is no additional heat wave or something similar. Obviously we're not going to touch the low end, but that's why we took a wider range. And I think it was not an easy decision. We understand that, but at the same time I definitely believe it's the right decision."},{"end_time":"510670","segment_id":9,"speaker":"Andrew Lazar","start_time":"473540","text":"Thanks for that. Then maybe as a follow up, the midpoint of organic growth guidance for the year would point to about 50 basis points of organic sales growth in the second half. If 3Q ultimately returns to some growth, as I think you hope it does, that would suggest, I guess not a whole lot of improvement between 3Q and 4Q. Am I thinking about that the right way or. I would think maybe some of the sellout demand sort of builds sequentially as you go through the year. But I'm just curious on your thoughts there. Thank you so much."},{"end_time":"537990","segment_id":10,"speaker":"Reuben Baldu","start_time":"511960","text":"Yeah, thanks Andrew. Let me take that. So you're right. Let me also for the sake of the benefit for the whole group. So our range between 0 and minus 2 assumes an H2 between a plus 2 and a half and a minus 1.5 and indeed the midpoint is plus a half. You're right that normally speaking we should see growth in quarter three, but also to be clear on what Stefan just said, and I know the optics of the weather, but just some data points, we've seen the market in, in quarter."},{"end_time":"541350","segment_id":11,"speaker":"Reuben Baldu","start_time":"537990","text":"2 in volume, minus 1 with Easter."},{"end_time":"550910","segment_id":12,"speaker":"Reuben Baldu","start_time":"541350","text":"We expect that to be plus 1.1.5, including the Easter we don't have all the sellout data yet for all markets, but for the markets for which we."},{"end_time":"553469","segment_id":13,"speaker":"Reuben Baldu","start_time":"550910","text":"Have it, from mid June to mid."},{"end_time":"564230","segment_id":14,"speaker":"Reuben Baldu","start_time":"553469","text":"July, we've seen market at -5 and a half.

Depends on what Stefan just said. What are we seeing through the course of the quarter? Yes. And if there's going to be quarter three, your mathematics are right.

Please go ahead."},{"end_time":"631990","segment_id":19,"speaker":"Steve Powers","start_time":"598190","text":"Great. Thank you very much, Ruben. Just to confirm on your 3Q commentary, you fully understand the marketplace trends into the quarter and the dynamics, but you are lapping the ERP supply disruption of a year ago. I think that was about a two and a half point negative to last year's sales versus consumption. Just want to clarify that and make sure that that comparison still factors into your outlook."},{"end_time":"661680","segment_id":20,"speaker":"Reuben Baldu","start_time":"632790","text":"Yeah, that's correct. So we indeed have the ERP lag, which was last year in August and September, and that was 2.5%. So also the numbers I just quoted, the two and a half on the top end of the range and the minus 1.5% on the bottom end of the range actually underlying are a bit worse. So you roughly talk about the top end is around 1.5 and the bottom end around minus 2 and a half. So we'll have that favorable comparison, although again, I have to repeat that what we've seen in July so far was a weak start, especially in the uk."},{"end_time":"691660","segment_id":21,"speaker":"Steve Powers","start_time":"662240","text":"Okay, understood. Thank you. The broader question, maybe you could talk a little bit more about the inflationary pressures you've seen build of late and how those are likely to flow through 2025 and then carry over into 26. And I know it's very early, but just any kind of round numbers in terms of the magnitude of pricing that you would be considering in 26 at this point, assuming that the trends hold. Thank you."},{"end_time":"749650","segment_id":22,"speaker":"Reuben Baldu","start_time":"691740","text":"Yeah, thank you for asking that question. It's an important question. So we started the year and we set it Also after quarter one remarks, we with an inflation assumption of around 2.5%. We saw that going into 4% last quarter and this quarter we're looking At a full year inflation of around 4.5%, the additional increase we've seen from 4 to 4.5 is again and I know the upticks, but if you look at the weather, to Stefan's point, it has been the hottest summer in Western Europe since ever. The Last one was 2003. It's not only the temperature, it's also the dry and the lack of rain. So UK had seen 70% more sunshine, which means we've had the worst crop for some one piece. And that is the main reason why our inflation assumption has moved from 4 to 4.5%. That's also the main reason why you also see the gross margin drop in quarter two now going forward. And as we said last time, we will take some price where we are."},{"end_time":"750490","segment_id":23,"speaker":"Reuben Baldu","start_time":"749650","text":"Able to do that."},{"end_time":"800530","segment_id":24,"speaker":"Reuben Baldu","start_time":"750570","text":"So for example, we will take some price in the uk, but if you take a step back, we have yearly negotiation cycles which are mainly quarter one and we don't see this as a reason to go up cycle. So a lot of the recovery of the inflation we have seen coming through in this year and before we talked about chicken and now we see some of the crops will have to be taken into pricing for next year. Then your question is what then about next year? Let's be clear. Our commitment now and our focus now is making sure we deliver our commitments for 2025 and we set the foundation and fundament for 2026. Yes, we will take pricing to recover in 26, but there are also some other puts and takes like for example, also some bonus releases which we had this year which will be a bit of a headwind next year."},{"end_time":"804530","segment_id":25,"speaker":"Steve Powers","start_time":"801730","text":"Okay, thank you very much.

Please go ahead."},{"end_time":"834300","segment_id":27,"speaker":"Scott Mark","start_time":"812220","text":"Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking our questions. First thing I wanted to ask about, you made some comments in the prepared remarks just about some of the SGA savings and targeted overhead expense reductions maybe just wondering if you can kind of share any more details around some of those initiatives and how we should be thinking about those for the remainder of this year and then into next year."},{"end_time":"889540","segment_id":28,"speaker":"Reuben Baldu","start_time":"835660","text":"Yeah, thank you. So we have indeed seen and you've seen it also in the presentation reduction sgna. Let's also be clear that is driven predominantly by overheads. So not by amv, but by overheads. Yes, there is an impact of some bonus releases and I don't want to go into detail of how much is what, but there's a substantial saving also because of our focus on cost. Competitiveness and our focus on bringing indirects down after inflation. So compensating for inflation. And it also links to the previous question in terms of pricing recovery. Yes, we will be taking pricing. We're also conscious that we need to be cost competitive and don't want to have an over price index versus our competition. So some of the savings we have been driving, like reductions in some of our support functions, some synergies we saw in some go to market organization will continue into 26 as well."},{"end_time":"920290","segment_id":29,"speaker":"Scott Mark","start_time":"892740","text":"Understood. Thanks for that. Next question I wanted to ask about is just around some of the innovations there was some commentary around, you know, in 2024, I think you said about 10% of sales were from innovation and renovation. This year that's expected to nearly double. Just wondering if you can kind of share some thoughts around the innovation pipeline and kind of how you see that shaping up for the rest of this year as well as next year. Thanks."},{"end_time":"1059960","segment_id":30,"speaker":"Stephane Deshmaker","start_time":"921250","text":"Well, to your point, let me split it in between two pieces. This year obviously is going to be higher than that in combination of renovation and innovation. And both are equally important for us because renovation is absolutely fundamental in terms of making sure that we keep we increase our security vis a vis our main competitors. That is private label and that's a key piece. And we have a very, very aggressive program in terms of making sure that obviously in terms we will be superior or equal, but definitely superior in terms of or machine battles. That's the first piece. And that program is well engaged. More to come obviously in the coming quarters. In terms of innovation, yes, the number little by little is increasing. We now have 6.5% which is a big difference compared to where we were in 22, 23, which had gone down big time, especially during that time where price was the only thing that mattered for the retailers and the consumers. And so in terms of innovation, well, you've seen a series of things that we're doing in terms of chicken, for example, in terms of fish, I mean a lot of inovino innovation in terms of snacking, which is a new area for us. So we were very much focused on in terms of family mealtime. I think there is a great opportunity for us in frozen food to go with snacking. And we're really starting this especially in Italy with fish strips and other things like that the same way. So a lot of things, you know, quite frankly at this stage, protein bowl is great as well. It's something that we're going to launch now in the next few weeks in the uk, in Netherlands, in Belgium, the countries are very excited by that. And then it's successful. And we think it's going to be successful. Obviously more to come in the coming years because obviously also something we're doing well and better and better is the move from one country to another through a list and launch. It's successful in one country, obviously we can go to other countries. So the program, you know, I mean, took a bit of time. I think it was a bit of. We were so focused on the Muslim battle that basically the rigor was not probably great in terms of innovation. It has changed, it is changing. We have the Muslim battles, we have the growth, the growth platforms in the new countries and that it's making a difference."},{"end_time":"1064760","segment_id":31,"speaker":"Scott Mark","start_time":"1062680","text":"Understood.

Please go ahead."},{"end_time":"1094760","segment_id":33,"speaker":"John Baumgartner","start_time":"1073640","text":"Good morning. Thanks for the question. First off, Ruben, just coming back to the comments on productivity. I'm wondering if you can discuss some of the newer initiatives. I think that this supply chain optimization program and the facility closure in Sweden. Can you elaborate a bit on this plan? What else is involved in the program and how should we think about the structural benefits?"},{"end_time":"1149630","segment_id":34,"speaker":"Reuben Baldu","start_time":"1096330","text":"Yes, thank you for asking that question. So what we need announced is a closure in a smaller factory in the Nordics. We've discussed some one on ones. In another discussion for our overall network, we actually see a program on a couple of axes. One is procurement, where I think we've already made great steps, but there's more to come which we can also drive in future years. And the second bit is on network, where we have to look at our total complexity of our network, the number of sites as well within a site, what we can do to optimize there. I've now been personally a year in the role, as you have also heard in our prepared remarks, together with Stefan, together with our whole exec, with our chief supply chain officer, we're embarking on a program to drive more cost competitive out of those programs. And we're keen to share more with you in the second half of the year."},{"end_time":"1168830","segment_id":35,"speaker":"John Baumgartner","start_time":"1151470","text":"Okay. And then coming back to innovation, can you, can you walk through the Future Foods lab you've established? You know, what categories are you focusing on there? Do you plan on taking ownership interests in any of the partners? Is it just more of a commercialization relationship? Just, you know, any. Any more detail? That would be helpful, thank you."},{"end_time":"1268810","segment_id":36,"speaker":"Stephane Deshmaker","start_time":"1169390","text":"Yeah, it's very interesting. It's obviously early in the game for us, but indeed we're learning how to partner with. Actually, I would put it that way. We were very much focused on ourselves for many years and I think we have evolved and we're learning now how to deal with new guys at the startups. We have some more to come in food service probably in the coming months. We have a first example. I will spare you the detail of this because it feels very, very highly confidential. But definitely it's the kind of things we've learned a lot with the startup and we're going to start with them in some countries where food service is present for us. You know that food service is big for us in southeastern Europe, in Switzerland, in the Nordics and also in Spain, Portugal. So we're going to start with that, but more to come in orders. But again, I don't want to come with a name right now because it's not, you know, it's still confidential but definitely going to come in the coming months. And the more to come with others, we also developing, by the way, pilot plants which also is going to help us and our partners to move faster in terms of innovation. I think the speed at which innovation is taking place is absolutely critical. And with this kind of steps we also can move faster and then be closer to the market. But there will be other things. You know, this portal is very interesting. We received a lot of attention from a lot of people and now in the process obviously of selecting the guys with whom we want to work. But it's very promising."},{"end_time":"1271770","segment_id":37,"speaker":"John Baumgartner","start_time":"1271210","text":"Thank you."},{"end_time":"1284860","segment_id":38,"speaker":"Operator","start_time":"1274250","text":"Again.

Please go ahead."},{"end_time":"1320620","segment_id":39,"speaker":"John Tanwen Tang","start_time":"1285980","text":"Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could talk about the portfolio and maybe this is a longer term question just how you might be dealing with hotter weather. Hotter weather on average structurally versus, you know, the true outliers like you saw in Q2. You know, we've seen more heat waves in recent years and if that's something you need to prepare for, you know, either in the portfolio, I don't know if it's moving ice cream out of the Adriatics or doing something, you know, with your crops and supply chain to, you know, position for that, just help us understand the long term positioning and how you might be dealing with that, if at all."},{"end_time":"1480840","segment_id":40,"speaker":"Stephane Deshmaker","start_time":"1320620","text":"Thank you. You know, John, I think it's not only, you know, how to move up to the challenge we expect we experience this year, it's also the fact that year in, year out, even with quote unquote, the normal weather, structurally frozen food is lower in the Summer than in the spring or winter, obviously, or later in the year. And then I think this combination of lower plus obviously the heat wave is something that we want to tackle. I mean, more seriously the difference compared to many years ago when I think the teams at a time tried something. We have, I mean, the opportunity is so much wider that, you know, we have, we have chicken, we didn't have chicken in the past. And chicken does very well, obviously with barbecues, marinated chicken, that kind of thing. That's one thing. We also still have red meat, by the way, that we also can experience much further with our retailers. Let's say something like natural fish. Natural fish exist in many very well developed in countries like Italy, for example. It's not deadlock the door or not enough, you know, in country, in a country like uk where it's mostly coated fish, well, you know, I can tell you when it's 30 degrees, you know, you don't necessarily want to eat a fish finger or fish stick. Well coated, let's say marinated fish or natural fish works very well. Potatoes, in terms of, you know, to get together with barbecue is also something we develop a lot. And I'm not even talking about, you know, the ice cream, which is something new for us. We have obviously a very strong goal in the Adriatics with Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia. And well, a bit accidentally, somehow we started to develop something in Austria, which is doing well because we had very strong, let's say strong people in Vienna. We had a lot of people coming from Croatia and it did well. So we're starting to develop these kind of things. Does that mean that we're going to do with ice cream in order? Not necessarily, but at least we have the assortment today that is available. And the first thing we're doing now is we're talking to other countries to see what they see. And also, very importantly, we're also starting the conversation with the trip because it has to be incremental and it can be incremental, but it requires also agility, how to move faster from one season to another. So a lot of things, a lot of opportunities. But definitely frozen food can do well with the hotter weather, with the summer and more specifically with the wind, heat waves."},{"end_time":"1493640","segment_id":41,"speaker":"John Tanwen Tang","start_time":"1482040","text":"Great, that's very helpful, Stephane.

Any thoughts there?"},{"end_time":"1528660","segment_id":42,"speaker":"Reuben Baldu","start_time":"1495240","text":"Yes. So thank you for that. We have done quite a bit of share buybacks in H100 million euros versus the year before for less than 20 million. We just announced a dividend. So I think from kind of capital allocation, we've done a lot with buybacks and with the dividend, you know, we want to keep our flexibility. In the past, we've shown to be a good M and A and being able to acquire good companies. But at this moment, with our current valuation also what's out there in the market, it's not that in the short term there's an M and A pipeline. Whether we're now committing to buyback, that also depends a bit on our overall flexibility."},{"end_time":"1531920","segment_id":43,"speaker":"John Tanwen Tang","start_time":"1531120","text":"Great.

If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press Star then two. At this time we'll pause momentarily to assemble our roster. The first question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks so much and thanks again to you guys for putting out the published prepared remarks. That's actually very helpful to us in kind of getting through the results pretty quickly. Maybe Stephan, just as a starting point, I guess what gives you the confidence and kind of the visibility that you finally called the full year guidance low enough? Given the pattern more recently of missing and guiding lower over the past Year. Thanks, Andrew. It's a great question and obviously it's a very important question for us. And let me stand back for just a second. I've been with the company for 10 years since we started and quite frankly, to your point, I don't think we've been accustomed to this. So it's really something that we need to take into consideration the guidance. The second point is at the same time over the last 10 years, with all the disruptions we've been through, I think we've been very good at learning from all these events. So let me first start with what I think is self inflicted and I'm really taking this on me. I think we were too optimistic with our Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) implementation. That's the first piece. And the second level, we also had an excessive inventory in Q1 that quite frankly we did a poor job at anticipating it. And quite frankly I'm taking these two points with me. I think the lessons though is in terms of our erp, we're slowing down the program just to make sure that we're taking the right level in terms of risk digestion of all the things we're doing, which is absolutely fundamental. And I'm very pleased with what the team is doing at this stage. And in terms of excess inventory and all these things between selling and sell out, quite frankly what I've seen is the team is doing a much, much, much better job at reading the visibility between both and let's say the dynamics between both, especially during these volatile times. So that's the first piece which is really, quite frankly I would call self inflicted. The second piece, especially in Q2 is the weather. Well, for information, June in Western Europe was the hottest June in record in the region. Some differences obviously Nordics was. But you. Take countries like France, like uk, like Belgium. Well, the numbers, , especially between,  mid June to mid July, well, you have numbers around, , minus 5, minus 6, minus 7% for the market as such, where quite frankly we would have expected to be in the region of 1.5 to 2% at the same time we've been able to regain market to gain market share, especially in volume, which is good. And despite the fact that our categories are especially fish and vegetables are under trading, especially during the hot weather. But that's not obviously not enough. So for us also the learning here is okay, what can we do to make sure that we have a better summer assortment? Because basically we don't know whether, , it's going to be a pattern for the future. But we need to be ready and to hedge our bet for the future for 20, 26 and beyond. And we have, , the teams are preparing things in terms of potatoes, in terms of,  natural fish and other things that we mentioned later so as to make sure that basically we have either, , obviously an additional opportunity for the future, which we always did, and obviously also how to hedge our bet versus what can happen in the future. We don't know that piece. Now, obviously with all these things and with all this volatility. Yes, we have decided to take a wider range to take into account potential risk, obviously mostly around additional continuing heat wave. We haven't seen it yet, , let's face it when it's interesting to see that first part of July was very hot and we've seen the numbers immediately in terms of sellout. And the second half was better, was better from our standpoint, obviously, which means milder weather. And we've seen immediately the correlation between the two. But this is why we're taking this range. Obviously there is no additional heat wave or something similar. Obviously we're not going to touch the low end, but that's why we took a wider range. And I think it was not an easy decision. We understand that, but at the same time I definitely believe it's the right decision. Thanks for that. Then maybe as a follow up, the midpoint of organic growth guidance for the year would point to about 50 basis points of organic sales growth in the second half. If 3Q ultimately returns to some growth, as I think you hope it does, that would suggest, I guess not a whole lot of improvement between 3Q and 4Q. Am I thinking about that the right way or. I would think maybe some of the sellout demand sort of builds sequentially as you go through the year. But I'm just curious on your thoughts there. Thank you so much. Yeah, thanks Andrew. Let me take that. So you're right. Let me also for the sake of the benefit for the whole group. So our range between 0 and minus 2 assumes an H2 between a plus 2 and a half and a minus 1.5 and indeed the midpoint is plus a half. You're right that normally speaking we should see growth in quarter three, but also to be clear on what Stefan just said, and I know the optics of the weather, but just some data points, we've seen the market in, in quarter. 2 in volume, minus 1 with Easter. We expect that to be plus 1.1.5, including the Easter we don't have all the sellout data yet for all markets, but for the markets for which we. Have it, from mid June to mid. July, we've seen market at -5 and a half. And we've seen that, to Stebbing's point, immediately reflected also in our sales, especially in northwest Europe, in big countries for us like uk. So that will have a drag on quarter three. So we're not committing to growth in quarter three. Depends on what Stefan just said. What are we seeing through the course of the quarter? Yes. And if there's going to be quarter three, your mathematics are right. And the midpoint assumes a bit more of a prudent assumption for quarter four. We're also very conscious that we've now lowered the guidance two times and we want to avoid that happening again. Thanks so much. Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you very much, Ruben. Just to confirm on your 3Q commentary, you fully understand the marketplace trends into the quarter and the dynamics, but you are lapping the ERP supply disruption of a year ago. I think that was about a two and a half point negative to last year's sales versus consumption. Just want to clarify that and make sure that that comparison still factors into your outlook. Yeah, that's correct. So we indeed have the ERP lag, which was last year in August and September, and that was 2.5%. So also the numbers I just quoted, the two and a half on the top end of the range and the minus 1.5% on the bottom end of the range actually underlying are a bit worse. So you roughly talk about the top end is around 1.5 and the bottom end around minus 2 and a half. So we'll have that favorable comparison, although again, I have to repeat that what we've seen in July so far was a weak start, especially in the uk. Okay, understood. Thank you. The broader question, maybe you could talk a little bit more about the inflationary pressures you've seen build of late and how those are likely to flow through 2025 and then carry over into 26. And I know it's very early, but just any kind of round numbers in terms of the magnitude of pricing that you would be considering in 26 at this point, assuming that the trends hold. Thank you. Yeah, thank you for asking that question. It's an important question. So we started the year and we set it Also after quarter one remarks, we with an inflation assumption of around 2.5%. We saw that going into 4% last quarter and this quarter we're looking At a full year inflation of around 4.5%, the additional increase we've seen from 4 to 4.5 is again and I know the upticks, but if you look at the weather, to Stefan's point, it has been the hottest summer in Western Europe since ever. The Last one was 2003. It's not only the temperature, it's also the dry and the lack of rain. So UK had seen 70% more sunshine, which means we've had the worst crop for some one piece. And that is the main reason why our inflation assumption has moved from 4 to 4.5%. That's also the main reason why you also see the gross margin drop in quarter two now going forward. And as we said last time, we will take some price where we are. Able to do that. So for example, we will take some price in the uk, but if you take a step back, we have yearly negotiation cycles which are mainly quarter one and we don't see this as a reason to go up cycle. So a lot of the recovery of the inflation we have seen coming through in this year and before we talked about chicken and now we see some of the crops will have to be taken into pricing for next year. Then your question is what then about next year? Let's be clear. Our commitment now and our focus now is making sure we deliver our commitments for 2025 and we set the foundation and fundament for 2026. Yes, we will take pricing to recover in 26, but there are also some other puts and takes like for example, also some bonus releases which we had this year which will be a bit of a headwind next year. Okay, thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Appreciate it. Our next question comes from Scott Mark with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking our questions. First thing I wanted to ask about, you made some comments in the prepared remarks just about some of the SGA savings and targeted overhead expense reductions maybe just wondering if you can kind of share any more details around some of those initiatives and how we should be thinking about those for the remainder of this year and then into next year. Yeah, thank you. So we have indeed seen and you've seen it also in the presentation reduction sgna. Let's also be clear that is driven predominantly by overheads. So not by amv, but by overheads. Yes, there is an impact of some bonus releases and I don't want to go into detail of how much is what, but there's a substantial saving also because of our focus on cost. Competitiveness and our focus on bringing indirects down after inflation. So compensating for inflation. And it also links to the previous question in terms of pricing recovery. Yes, we will be taking pricing. We're also conscious that we need to be cost competitive and don't want to have an over price index versus our competition. So some of the savings we have been driving, like reductions in some of our support functions, some synergies we saw in some go to market organization will continue into 26 as well. Understood. Thanks for that. Next question I wanted to ask about is just around some of the innovations there was some commentary around, you know, in 2024, I think you said about 10% of sales were from innovation and renovation. This year that's expected to nearly double. Just wondering if you can kind of share some thoughts around the innovation pipeline and kind of how you see that shaping up for the rest of this year as well as next year. Thanks. Well, to your point, let me split it in between two pieces. This year obviously is going to be higher than that in combination of renovation and innovation. And both are equally important for us because renovation is absolutely fundamental in terms of making sure that we keep we increase our security vis a vis our main competitors. That is private label and that's a key piece. And we have a very, very aggressive program in terms of making sure that obviously in terms we will be superior or equal, but definitely superior in terms of or machine battles. That's the first piece. And that program is well engaged. More to come obviously in the coming quarters. In terms of innovation, yes, the number little by little is increasing. We now have 6.5% which is a big difference compared to where we were in 22, 23, which had gone down big time, especially during that time where price was the only thing that mattered for the retailers and the consumers. And so in terms of innovation, well, you've seen a series of things that we're doing in terms of chicken, for example, in terms of fish, I mean a lot of inovino innovation in terms of snacking, which is a new area for us. So we were very much focused on in terms of family mealtime. I think there is a great opportunity for us in frozen food to go with snacking. And we're really starting this especially in Italy with fish strips and other things like that the same way. So a lot of things, you know, quite frankly at this stage, protein bowl is great as well. It's something that we're going to launch now in the next few weeks in the uk, in Netherlands, in Belgium, the countries are very excited by that. And then it's successful. And we think it's going to be successful. Obviously more to come in the coming years because obviously also something we're doing well and better and better is the move from one country to another through a list and launch. It's successful in one country, obviously we can go to other countries. So the program, you know, I mean, took a bit of time. I think it was a bit of. We were so focused on the Muslim battle that basically the rigor was not probably great in terms of innovation. It has changed, it is changing. We have the Muslim battles, we have the growth, the growth platforms in the new countries and that it's making a difference. Understood. We'll pass it on. Thanks so much. Our next question comes from John Baumgartner with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Good morning. Thanks for the question. First off, Ruben, just coming back to the comments on productivity. I'm wondering if you can discuss some of the newer initiatives. I think that this supply chain optimization program and the facility closure in Sweden. Can you elaborate a bit on this plan? What else is involved in the program and how should we think about the structural benefits? Yes, thank you for asking that question. So what we need announced is a closure in a smaller factory in the Nordics. We've discussed some one on ones. In another discussion for our overall network, we actually see a program on a couple of axes. One is procurement, where I think we've already made great steps, but there's more to come which we can also drive in future years. And the second bit is on network, where we have to look at our total complexity of our network, the number of sites as well within a site, what we can do to optimize there. I've now been personally a year in the role, as you have also heard in our prepared remarks, together with Stefan, together with our whole exec, with our chief supply chain officer, we're embarking on a program to drive more cost competitive out of those programs. And we're keen to share more with you in the second half of the year. Okay. And then coming back to innovation, can you, can you walk through the Future Foods lab you've established? You know, what categories are you focusing on there? Do you plan on taking ownership interests in any of the partners? Is it just more of a commercialization relationship? Just, you know, any. Any more detail? That would be helpful, thank you. Yeah, it's very interesting. It's obviously early in the game for us, but indeed we're learning how to partner with. Actually, I would put it that way. We were very much focused on ourselves for many years and I think we have evolved and we're learning now how to deal with new guys at the startups. We have some more to come in food service probably in the coming months. We have a first example. I will spare you the detail of this because it feels very, very highly confidential. But definitely it's the kind of things we've learned a lot with the startup and we're going to start with them in some countries where food service is present for us. You know that food service is big for us in southeastern Europe, in Switzerland, in the Nordics and also in Spain, Portugal. So we're going to start with that, but more to come in orders. But again, I don't want to come with a name right now because it's not, you know, it's still confidential but definitely going to come in the coming months. And the more to come with others, we also developing, by the way, pilot plants which also is going to help us and our partners to move faster in terms of innovation. I think the speed at which innovation is taking place is absolutely critical. And with this kind of steps we also can move faster and then be closer to the market. But there will be other things. You know, this portal is very interesting. We received a lot of attention from a lot of people and now in the process obviously of selecting the guys with whom we want to work. But it's very promising. Thank you. Again. If you have a question, please press star then one. Our next question comes from John Tanwen Tang with CJS Securities. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could talk about the portfolio and maybe this is a longer term question just how you might be dealing with hotter weather. Hotter weather on average structurally versus, you know, the true outliers like you saw in Q2. You know, we've seen more heat waves in recent years and if that's something you need to prepare for, you know, either in the portfolio, I don't know if it's moving ice cream out of the Adriatics or doing something, you know, with your crops and supply chain to, you know, position for that, just help us understand the long term positioning and how you might be dealing with that, if at all. Thank you. You know, John, I think it's not only, you know, how to move up to the challenge we expect we experience this year, it's also the fact that year in, year out, even with quote unquote, the normal weather, structurally frozen food is lower in the Summer than in the spring or winter, obviously, or later in the year. And then I think this combination of lower plus obviously the heat wave is something that we want to tackle. I mean, more seriously the difference compared to many years ago when I think the teams at a time tried something. We have, I mean, the opportunity is so much wider that, you know, we have, we have chicken, we didn't have chicken in the past. And chicken does very well, obviously with barbecues, marinated chicken, that kind of thing. That's one thing. We also still have red meat, by the way, that we also can experience much further with our retailers. Let's say something like natural fish. Natural fish exist in many very well developed in countries like Italy, for example. It's not deadlock the door or not enough, you know, in country, in a country like uk where it's mostly coated fish, well, you know, I can tell you when it's 30 degrees, you know, you don't necessarily want to eat a fish finger or fish stick. Well coated, let's say marinated fish or natural fish works very well. Potatoes, in terms of, you know, to get together with barbecue is also something we develop a lot. And I'm not even talking about, you know, the ice cream, which is something new for us. We have obviously a very strong goal in the Adriatics with Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia. And well, a bit accidentally, somehow we started to develop something in Austria, which is doing well because we had very strong, let's say strong people in Vienna. We had a lot of people coming from Croatia and it did well. So we're starting to develop these kind of things. Does that mean that we're going to do with ice cream in order? Not necessarily, but at least we have the assortment today that is available. And the first thing we're doing now is we're talking to other countries to see what they see. And also, very importantly, we're also starting the conversation with the trip because it has to be incremental and it can be incremental, but it requires also agility, how to move faster from one season to another. So a lot of things, a lot of opportunities. But definitely frozen food can do well with the hotter weather, with the summer and more specifically with the wind, heat waves. Great, that's very helpful, Stephane. And then second, just any update on the capital allocation priorities with the stock indicating down you've done repurchases or maybe there's a preference for debt repayment here. Any thoughts there? Yes. So thank you for that. We have done quite a bit of share buybacks in H100 million euros versus the year before for less than 20 million. We just announced a dividend. So I think from kind of capital allocation, we've done a lot with buybacks and with the dividend, you know, we want to keep our flexibility. In the past, we've shown to be a good M and A and being able to acquire good companies. But at this moment, with our current valuation also what's out there in the market, it's not that in the short term there's an M and A pipeline. Whether we're now committing to buyback, that also depends a bit on our overall flexibility. Great. Thank you. This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Stephan Dustin Maker for any closing remarks. Thank you, Operator. So while I'm disappointed by your first half performance, I remain nonetheless confident in the future that lies ahead of us. We have a great portfolio, we have a strategy that is working and we have a talented team of people well equipped to deliver the plans we have in front of us. We have successfully stabilized our market share and have compelling plans to increase our competitiveness in the back half of the year. We are well positioned to delivering accelerating growth when weather disruption subsides. I look forward to demonstrating that with results when we update you again next quarter. Thank you for your time and interest in Nomad Foods. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Please go ahead. hello and welcome to nom Nomad Foods first quarter 2025 earnings call I am Jason English, head of investor. Relations. And I'm joined on the call by Stefan Dutchmaker, our CEO, and Ruben Bel. Beldu, our CFO. By now, everyone should have access to the earnings release for the period. Ended March 31, 2025, that was published at approximately 645. A. M. Eastern time. The press release and investor presentation are available. On Nomad Foods website@nomadfoods.com. this call. Is being webcast and the replay will be available on the company's website. This conference call will include forwardlooking statements that are based on our view of the company's prospect. Prospects, expectations, and intentions. At this time, actual results may differ. Due to the risks and uncertainties which are discussed in our press release. Our filings for the sec. And our investor presentation, which includes cautionary language, we will. Discuss nonifrs financial measures during the call today. These non IFRs.

Primarily for, when applicable, share based pavement expenses and related employer payroll tax. Taxes, exceptional figures and foreign currency translation charges or. Gains. Unless otherwise noted, comments from here on refer to those adjust. Adjusted numbers. With that, I will hand over to Stefan. Thank you. Jason Nomad Foods has now entered its 10th year. As a public company and the environment in which we celebrate. Our 10th anniversary is so far proving to be anything but borrowing. The good news is that we have built a resili. Resilient organization and portfolio. That is related to whether. The current economic environment. Our lead. Leading brands remains healthy. And as I will illustrate in a few moment, Moments. Our category in Europe is strong. Fur. Furthermore. I remain confident in our strategy. Our commercial flywheel is spinning at a good rate producing attract. Attractive innovation. Impactful merchandising and compelling. Advertising. And while performance can be choppy, Month to month or even quarter to quarter, I think you will agree the trend line of our underlying improvement highlights the strength of our business model. And with that, let me turn my attention to result on slide three. Our retail sales through rows, modestly in the quarter, which. Was in line with our expectations. We call last? Quarter that we guided through a slower start of the year given the timing of. Our growth initiatives as well as the later Easter this year. This largely played out as expected. And I'm pleased that the organization was able to deliver another quarter of. Gross margin expansion. This as well as. Overread savings that we are just now beginning to realize. Help fund a double digit increase in ANP this quarter. And our strong cash flow has allowed us to continue. Returning cash to shareholders and reinvest in our business. In fact, in the first quarter, we repurchased 49 million. Euro of shares and paid our 25 million euro of dividends. This collective 74 million. Of euro in the first quarter. Marks a 100 and. 52% increase versus what we returned to shareholders in the. First quarter last year. We. Have a lot to celebrate. But at the same time, I recognize that our. Industry is facing headwinds to overcome. Our net sales, for example. Lagged ourselves through by a larger negative than expected amount in the first. Quarter, as we see, is greater than expected retail inventory. Destocking across Europe. Meanwhile. We are seeing some increased valueseeking behavior by consumers. And our input cost outlook has modestly increased. We will offset this cost pressure with targeted pricing as. We have successfully done in the past. But these increases. Will take time to fully implement. And. Rather than curtail investment to mitigate some of these headwinds. We continue to invest behind our brands and products for. The longterm health of our business. Based on these factors, we believe it is prudent to lower. Our full year organic revenue adjusted EBITDA and adjust dps. Growth ranges for the full year 2025. Rube. Ruben will share more details on the quarter and full year outlook in a few minutes. I do not want this natum volatility. And retailer inventory destocking to detract. From the big picture. As you have heard say. Before. We have a category and pottery advantage that positions us. For longterm success. As you can. See on slide four, the frozen category in Europe remains healthy. Growth of the category slowed in 2024. But it has recently accelerated, driven by improved volume and value. Gains and is once again outpacing the overall food. Market. We expect the category growth in the near term to remain choppy, especially in markets like the Uk. Where industrywide promotional activity is being reduced. To offset inflation. But we do believe the category result performance versus the whole. Food industry is a longterm dynamic. The frozen category has outgrown the overall food industry by. Nearly one percentage point over the past decade, and we are happy to. See it resuming its leadership position. The category continues to benefit from the secular trends of conven. Convenience, sustainability. Value and great tasting food. In fact, with the adoption of air fryers, We are increasingly able to deliver restaurant quality food from. The freezer. With lower preparation times and higher. Consumer satisfaction than prior preparation methods. While. Saving consumers substantial money. Relative to the restaurant. Restaurants alternative. We are excited about the longterm. Growth opportunity in our category, and we especially appreciate. How our portfolio's position within it. As a reminder, two thirds of our revenue is generated. From lean proteins and vegetables. And 94. Percent of our UK and Western Europe revenue is generated from projects deemed. A healthy meal choice by the UK government. We believe we are well positioned to meet consumers evolving nutritional needs. We believe this pot will advantage combined with our effect. Effective strategy and Gotomarket playbook. Was. A key contributor to the improved market share performance we achieved over the last six months of 2020. Four, as you can see on slide five. E share gains have stored in the first quarter of 2025. But this was largely as expected. As I mentioned earlier, many. Of our key growth initiatives are scheduled to begin the second quarter. These initiatives are centered around our mushroom battles. Especially fish. While our investment behind our growth platform. Platforms has continued at a steady pace. And that investment is. Paying off. Net salesforce platforms rose 36. Percent year over year. In the first quarter. Chicken remains a success story for us, the team. Has also delivered impressive wins in other categories. In the UK, for example, we now have nearly 2% share. Of the frozen ship market versus 0% this time last year. In Germany. We have doubled our ret. Retail sales of prepared meals year on year in the first quarter. We will continue to invest behind these growth platforms to. Keep our momentum going. But at the same time, we will not. Lose focus on our muslim battles. So let's be vertical acceleration plans behind our mission battles. We have exciting plans to drive growth behind all. Our Mersuin battles, but I'm especially excited about the new news we have. This year to grow our core fish portfolio. Fish is critical to a success. It accounts for a third of our revenue and. Is margin accretive. We are fortunate that. This nutrition profile plays so well. Into the evolving consumer. Nutritional demands as a nutrientrich source of lead protein. That tastes great. It is our. Job to ensure that it remains exciting and top of mind for consumers. And we have a fully integrated playbook designed to do just that. Starting with advertising. Later this year, we will be launching a new master brand advertis. Advertising campaign that reinforces. The test appeal and positive. Nutrition profile. Of our frozen food brands. And, of course, our fishboard for you will be one of the stars in the campaign. As these ads are airing, we will simultaneously be executing. Impactful machine, adding activity to drive impulse purchase at retail. While ensuring the optimal value equation for consumers. And we are investing in our products. Renovation plays an important role. We are committed to always delivering the best quality. And are currently investing in renovating our fish fingers to deliver more test. Or crunch, more delight. These new, improved products will be rolling out through this year. Innovation is also a critical part of the plan, and we have a long history of. Developing better testing, more appetizing offerings that. Are proven to drive consumer demand. We remain on track to increase our innovation as a percentage of sales. Ratio again in 2025. And fish is. An important part of this plan. On slide six. You can see the new captain's discovery line that has recently launched in the. Uk. These products are anchored in. Flavor exciting and help us keep our thoughts for the modern with great. Testing products and new varieties for consumers to spice up. Their dinner. Also on this slide. You can see. Our fish bass brand of products that. We relaunched in Italy last year. Italy is an interesting. Case study for us. This time last year the country manage. Management team was embarking on the same path that we are now pursuing across many market. Markets. Fish growth through the playbook. Very similar to what I have been describing. Our italian team leaned in with a fully integrated plan. Strong. Media investment was overlaid with impactful merchandising events. That hit relevant price points while being integrated with. Thematical promotions such as our playmobile event. And it was supported by both renovation. And innovation behind our fish, bas. Of these products on this slide. And results speak for themselves. Growth improved for both snow categories. Retail sales for fish products accelerated to 6% in Italy in the fourth. Quarter of last year. And rose 9% in the first quarter of this year. And while we're gaining share. We're also supporting category growth, which is up 6% so far this year. Fish bar has been. A meaningful contributor to this growth, and the brand is helping us expand. Categories consumption with offerings for snack or. Mini meat occasion. Occasions where fish, and especially fish finger. Fingers has not historically been considered an attractive option. We are seeing the brands buy rates among existing. Fish consumer grow while at the same time. Fish bar. Is attracting new consumers to the category. We are growing. Penetration with younger and higher income consumers. We are breathing new life and relevance into fish fingers in Italy. And I'm excited to see what we can accomplish in other markets this year. So while the environment is not easy and we are. Facing some headwinds. We have a lot to look forward to. We are confident that organic sales will return to growth beginning in the. Second quarter, and we expect to achieve profitable growth for the remainder. Of the year and beyond. With that. Let. Me turn it to Ruben to take you through our results and not look in more detail. Ruben. Thank you, Stefan. And good morning, everyone. Let me. Get right into the results. As you can see on slide seven and eight for the first. Quarter reported net revenues decreased by 3% to. 760,000,000 euro. Organic sales declined 3.6%. With volume declining -3.7% while price. Mix inflected into slight positive territory. Retail. Sellthrough dough was slightly positive in the quarter at plus 0.2%. Which means that our selling let sellthrough by nearly four percentage points in the. Quarter. We believe that the later timing of Easter this year accounted. For roughly one percentage point of the gap, and we expect to recover. That in the second quarter, we attribute the remainder of the gap to retailer inventory. This stocking which was greater than we had expected. We believe that retailers are likely to keep inventory levels at this now lower level as a result. We do not expect to benefit. From retailers building inventory backup in the future. Despite the top line deleverage in the quarter, we were pleased to grow our gross Mar. Margin by 90 basis point yearonyear to 27.8%. Productivity savings from our supply chain team contrib. Contributed to the gross margin expansion, as did lapping and negative. Inventory revaluation had been in the first quarter of 24. Moving down to pnl. Adjusted operating expenses. Rose 3% year and year in the first quarter. This was entirely drive. Driven by double digit increase in amp. In fact, our over. Overhead extends modestly contracted yearonyear despite underlying Inf. Inflation. Over the past two years, we have made meaningful investments. In areas such as cybersecurity and revenue growth management capabilities. With these capabilities now established, we have begun to drive. Inefficiencies out of our overhead expenses. We were happy to. See these efforts begin to drive returns this quarter. But. Despite these savings, our adjusted EBITDA decreased 1.8% year. In year to 120,000,000 euro, while adjusted eps. Fell 5.4% to 35 euro cents given the net sales contract. Contraction. Turning to cash flow on slide. Nine. Higher working capital pressured free cash flow in the quarter, causing. Our adjusted free cash flow conversion ratio as a percentage of after tax. Profits to fall to 24%. The primary driver of. The unfavorable working capital was higher. Finished goods, inventories. We produced product for east in the quarter, but those did not ship until the. Second quarter. The greater than expected retailer inventory. This stocking also contributed to higher inventory levels given the associat. Associated sales shortfall. Neither of these dynamics should have an impact on. The full year cash flow. Turning to use of cash as stef. Stefan mentioned, we continue to return cash to shareholders. In the first quarter, we repurchased roughly \u20ac49 million of shares. While paying out slightly more than 25 million euro dividends. The collective return of nearly \u20ac75 million was. More than 52%, higher than the first quarter of 24. And last week. We declared a quarterly dividend of $17 cents, which is. 13% higher than the same dividend last year. Turning to our guidance for 2025 on slide ten. As I previously mentioned, we do not expect to recover the sales we lost. In the first quarter due to retailer inventory. Stock in. Addition, the macro uncertainty has caused us to risk adjust our forecast further. Especially in the UK, where the category is cycling. A tough comparison. In the second quarter and where we are seeing some downtrending from consumers. As a result, we have lowered a full year organic sales growth. Outlook to zero to 2% growth versus our prior outlook of one. To 3% draft on top of the lower sales outlook. We. Also now foresee slightly more cost pressure coming from some of our input costs. We expect to be able to offset much of these higher cost. With incremental pricing. As those of you who have followed us for a while know. We have a long track record. Of successfully taking price to. Recover cost increases. We expect these increases will take time to. Implement, and the cost price lag is likely to result in gross margin pressure in. The near term. We have the flexibility within our PNL. To offset the impact of the incremental cost pressure and slightly lower. Sales growth by curtailing some of our investments in our brands and product renovations. But we are focused on ensuring that we continue to invest in the longterm. Health of our business. As a result, we are lowering our full year. Adjusted EBITDA guidance to zero to plus 2% yearonyear growth from our prior outlook of plus two to 4% growth. The impact of the lower EBda outlook is partially offset at the APS line per share repurchases. As a result. We have widened our EPS growth in our outlook at the low end, resulting. In a range of plus two to 6% growth versus our prior outlook. Of plus four to 6% growth, this equates to \u20ac1. 82 to \u20ac1.89, or $2.07 to two. Dollars 15 at recent exchange rates, turning to free. Cash flow. We continue to expect a conversion ratio of 90% or. Greater as we expected. Timingrelated headwinds to cash flow in the first Qu? Quarter to reverse throughout the year. Owen while we face some incremental headwinds that we had not expected at the start of. The year. We continue to feel good about the underlying health of our. Business. Our flywheel is working, and we have compelling and wellfunded. Marketing, merchandising, innovation and renovation plan scheduled for. The remainder of the year. We expect these plans to drive resumed top. Line growth beginning in the second quarter and sustain improved momentum throughout. The remainder of the year while the mechle environment has become. Increasingly uncertain. We believe that our updated outlook affords. Us the flexibility to navigate incremental headwinds should they ris. Rise. With that, I will now turn the call back to the operator to open the line. For questions. Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session to ask a question. You may press start then one on your telephone keypad. If. You're using a speaker phone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. If at any time your question has been addressed and you would like to. Withdraw your question, please press start. Then two at this. Time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. The first question comes from. Scott Marks with Jeffrey, please go ahead. Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking our questions. This. Morning. First. Morning. First question for me. The retailer destock that you mentioned. I know. We've heard. A lot about that. I think here in the US, maybe not as much. In Europe. So just wondering if you can kind of share some color on that in terms. Of were there any particular countries or any specific categories? Of yours where you saw more of an impact. Yeah. Thank you. That wasn't even an impact. We've. Seen in the quarter. Having said that already before, the quarter saw some. Facing between. New year and the old. Year. So we already said, look, we expect the quarter to be a bit soft, but. It was more so than we had expected. And back to your question. It was quite broad. Based. So in most of our countries, we've seen that. We're checking. 15 countries, and I would say. Twelve to 13 of those. Countries we've seen at these stocking. It was also quite broad based. Across segments and also across most wind battles. We do track stock. We have actually now also tracking off stock, look at Verb, Mosby and Bettel. So we think also that vast amount of this destocking is now behind us, maybe one or two. Marks, like potentially the UK, but that's what we've seen, so it was broad. Based. It was broad based. Was also not limited to. December, Jan. That took us a bit, a bit later. In the quarter, which was pubgraded, the part that wasn't expected. Understood. Thanks for that. And then I guess with the new revised. Outlook for the year. Wondering if you can just kind of speak to expect. Expectations for category growth. I know you talked about still healthy. Category. Maybe a little choppy given some of the macro uncertainty, but. Just wondering if you can update us on your outlook for kind of category growth. And your market share performance within it for the year. Thanks so much. Well, the thing is, to your point, I think. The category we men healthy. Which. Is really good news for us. To your point, I think we have slightly reduced. Or supply, which means that this, by the way, as a result, with the starting. Point. Yes. We go into? The next quarters. And. We'll grow market share. As well. That's the point. I think what we see is interesting to see is. After? Probably. A slightly more difficult. Quart. Quarter in terms of market share. Q four. Is starting to be for survey. Is now slight. Slightly positive in terms of value and. Definite history. In volume, so which is good news for us. I think the only thing is we know weekly it's going to take a bit more. Time is in. The uk. Because basically you have also a lot of promo. In Q two so last year. So it's basically the comes are. More difficult. And second, something we need to also take into account. For the near future is last year. Due to. Draatics. The weather was fantastic, and as you know, we have a part of our business. Businesses. Ice cream. We love it, but definitely something we can't. Plan the same way, but overall, by the way, The Ascom business. Remains extremely healthy. Yes. And just to build on that, so. Again, as we said before, this remains a strong category has outperform. Outperformed total foods in Europe by more than 1%. If you look at. More the longer term. If you look at the kind of year today, we see cabbage. Like bulk, we continue to grow very well. We see fish. Relatively strong growth in the line around mobile and a half percent, so that's also good. Back to Stefan's point, a lot of countries are growing. We see some softness in the. Uk, also in P four. And then a bit of the ice. We start. With the comparable. Also important to know that we knew from the start that. When we see. The quality, let's say the quantity. Of activation programs in terms of renovation, innovation, and also. Obviously at the store level and in terms of price was very much. More in Q two, Q three, Q four, as opposed to Q one. So. We knew from the start that you was probably the softest. Quarter of the year. Understood. I'll pass it on. Thanks so much. Thank you. The next question comes from John Bamgartner with Mizoho. Please go ahead. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Maybe to stick with the. Destocking looking at the Nielsen data, the volumes for the quart. Quarter, the categories didn't look too bad. Do you have a sense that it's. Working capital related, or is retailers sort of bracing for incremental weakness? Going forward. It didn't seem to align with the measure channel data. And maybe. It's nomad specific. Any color on that front? So. We've seen. So just if you take a step back also to understand this. Quarter. We grew in the quarter. Incela with plus 0.2%. In sellout. We did. As you also seen in the presentation. Lost market share in certain capital. Some of that was expected in terms of. Phasing of activities. But we did see that our sellout has been. Less than the total category. And to Stefan's point, we see the recovery now. In P four. With this complex debt UK's the overall market is. A bit more soft and we see ice cream. So we did have a difference between. Us and the category in the border. And the big difference on the plus zero? .2 and what to sell in -3.6 a big part of that is vast. Major. Majority of that is distocking. Okay. Thanks, Ruben. And then to follow up in terms of the new products, the innovation, the new geographies. You mentioned you're pulling new consumers, both new to the category, new to the. Brand. I'm curious at this point, if you have enough information on that. Do you have a sense as to, number one, where your consumers are shifting from. Is it from smaller brands or from private label? And then number. Two for those consumers new to the category are those consumers coming to. The category from different temperature states, like fresh produce, fresh fish, or is it. From other frozen categories. Well, the thing is, it's interesting, you know that. We very strong, John, in terms of family meal time. And I think. What we're seeing right now, and it's very interesting. A lot of. Innovations, even to some extent, our innovations are going more and more. To. The snacking side. And we as leader. In the category. We believe that frozen food can play a fantastic role in terms of. Snacking. So we've seen, for example, in Belgium. That's interesting to see. We had a lot of idols. Queues and we put them together. As a category in terms of. Snacking. So no real innovation. Just put them together. It's working. Extremely well. Second piece is. Well, you know, we have. Fish fingers, which is really the iconic, you know, family meal time across. Europe. Now we're moving to what we call fish bar, which. Is much more snacking occasion and we're starting in Italy. And it's doing extremely well. So we know that there is a space. To begin for us in that category independently from. Where they're coming from. First we've been frozen, but also from, obviously. From chips and from ambience, but definitely. For us. It's a wide space, and it's a wide space where we have. Any only intent to gain over time, starting now. But. Definitely you will hear more about snacking and inform. Informal eating whatever the nazarenation in the coming quart. Quarters and to build on Stefan's head. We've proven to do that in Italy. Where actually, with chicken, we've been able to grow the total frozen food category. Really came as growth on top for the retail as well. And we're making step. For examples, with secondary placement of frozen food freezes next to. Chill to drive that conversion. I mean, that will be step by step so that we can do. That on a massive amount in Europe, but we're making those steps to drive, actually. Total capital growth and transferring consumers from other categories. And if you add in air fryer with a penetration in Europe is huge. Right now in the UK, I think it's 80%. So it's really. Big utilization rate is really high as well. That's definitely. Kind of thing that does well for frozen food. So this combina. Combination of things. Definitely. We want to invest in snacking, and we think we have the right to play there and to win. Great. Thanks for your time. You wake up. Thanks, John. Thank you. Again if you have. A question, please? Press star, then one. The. Next question comes from John than one thing with CJ. Cjs securities, please go ahead. Hi. Good morning and thank you. For taking my questions. You guys mentioned being able to. Adjust. Hi, Stefan. You mentioned being able to adjust the intensity of. Your brand and amp investment. To be clear. Is that included? In your guidance already? Or is it just a lever to pull if you see incremental headwind at. This point. It's included guidance to make it. Very simple. So. We keep the job. I think, obviously there is sometimes a bit more pressure, but definitely. We are the brand builders, so we want to keep it that way. But again, We shouldn't limit it to amp. I think it's a combination of. Different things you've seen. What? Obviously. 360 approach, so. Mp is part of it. But definitely. It's part of it, but. It's a combination of. Sometimes price investments, renovation. In some categories, innovation. In others. So it's a lot of things, but definitely. We keep we have only intend to keep investing. Okay, great. Thank you. And then just any more. Color on where your inputs are increasing. Is that a trade or tariff or. Currency issue, or is it something else specific to a specific input? No. That is not. Thanks for the question. That's not a tariff impact, by the way. Also on that point, we're not imp. Impacted by tariff. You never know what happens in the future, but this moment we don't. See that. You might have more medium long term indirect impacts, but also that at. The moment, we don't see the impact. We're seeing as much on proteins, so. It's in chicken and in red meat. And part of that is demand for proteins. Part of that is also that we've seen in Europe. Asian food on the poultry side impacting us. And as. We said just when going through the presentation. This company has proven to have the pricing power and have taken quite some pricing. In the past. But. We've also chosen. Not to go into big clashes with trade in. Year also because this inflation was creeping up in the last couple of months. So we will take. Pricing, but a lot of this higher inflation will be compensated next year. Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you. Anyone who wishes to ask a question, please press start. Then one. We. Have a follow up question from John Tanwantang with CJ. CJS securities, please go ahead. Hi. Thanks for the follow up. Just wanted to follow up on the question of being able to pass. Pricing. Through. You mentioned the consumers. We're trading down a little bit as well, at the same. Time. I'm wondering if there's maybe a little bit more elasticity in your ability. To. Price. As you look forward, number one and number two. If you have any color on what the private labels and the discounters are doing, that will be helpful as well. Well, I think to your point, I think when the situation is a bit volatile, I think going directly back to Reuben's point, I think. People obviously are looking a bit more. For value. I mean, seeking. Obviously price as opposed to anything else at the same time. Well, as I said. We are back to. Stable to slightly positive market share before. Which is good news. And our job is obviously to find the right. Equation. So sometimes. There will be price investments. We did it last year, for example, in Italy, in fish. But that's. Why? The combination of many different things. Most of the time, we never go. For only price. It's going to be a combination, obviously, of renovation. Of obviously. A new advertising campaign to put together, obviously. With install activation. So that's the kind of things. We're going to do. And as I said, I think what we see right now is. Yes. These counters have a bit of key way during the first quarter. But. As far as we are concerned. We back on track in terms of. Market share. And slightly positive in terms of volume, market share. Okay, great. Thank you. Just in the outlook. The updated outlook with the zero to 2%. Organic growth. Is there any specific expectation for volume versus price in there? Yeah. So you've seen that? In last year. The build up of volume and price. We expect in quarter two. And we said, Before that quarter two. There's this phasing of Easter. We think that's. About 1%. Already the growth of the market. We do also see some soft. Softness in the UK and the start of the ice cream in April, which doesn't help. On the market mix, but we expect part two to being buoyant and then. Back to the point in pricing, but also RGM activities that will kick in in the second. Half of the year, so we expect. Pricing the growth in the second half. To be more. On price and quarter tomorrow, but. Overall at full year basis is going to be a combination of both. Definitely. Okay, great. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. This concludes our question and answer session. I would now like to turn the. Conference. Back over to Mr. Stefan the shamaker for any closing remarks. Thank you of the waitthrough. So, yeah, I'm proud of the progress our company has made over the past. Nine years. And confident that we on track to deliver another rel. Relatively strong year in 2025. Our strategy is working. And our teams have developed compelling plans to deliver improved. Growth for the remainder of this year. I look forward to demonstrating that. With results when we update you again next quarter. And thank you for your. Time and interest in nomad foods. The conference has now concluded.

Nomad Foods has Now entered its 10th year as a public company and the environment in which we celebrate our 10th anniversary is so far proving to be anything but boring. The good news is that we have built a resilient organization and portfolio that is willing to weather the current economic environment. Our leading brands remain healthy and as I will illustrate in a few moments, our category in Europe is strong. Furthermore, I remain confident in our strategy. Our commercial flywheel is spinning at a good rate, producing attractive innovation, impactful merchandising and compelling advertising. And while performance can be choppy month to month or even quarter to quarter, I think you will agree that the trend line of our underlying improvement highlights the strength of our business model and with that let me turn my attention to results on Slide 3. Our retail sell through rose modestly. in the quarter, which was in line with expectations. Recall last quarter that we guided to a slower start of the year given the timing of our growth initiatives as well as the later Easter this year. This largely played out as expected"},{"end_time":"259630","segment_id":4,"speaker":"UNKNOWN","start_time":"259350","text":"And."},{"end_time":"883150","segment_id":5,"speaker":"Stephan","start_time":"259630","text":"I'm pleased that our organization was able to deliver another quarter of gross margin expansion. This, as well as overweight savings that we are just now beginning to realize helped fund a double digit increase in ANP this quarter and our strong cash flow has allowed us to continue returning cash to shareholders and reinvesting our business. In fact, in the first quarter we repurchased 49 million euros of shares and paid our 25 million euros of dividends. This collective 74 million euros in the first quarter marks a 152% increase versus what we returned to shareholders in the first quarter last year. We have a lot to celebrate, but at the same time I recognize that our industry is facing headwinds to overcome. Our net sales, for example, lagged our sales through by a larger negative than expected amount in the first quarter as we face greater than expected retail inventory destocking across Europe. Meanwhile, we are seeing some increased value seeking behavior by consumers and our input cost outlook has modestly increased. We will offset this cost pressure with targeted pricing as we have successfully done in the past, but these increases will take time to fully implement and rather than curtail investment to mitigate some of these headwinds, we continue to invest behind our brands and products for the long term health of our business. Based on these factors, we believe it is prudent to lower our full year organic revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS growth ranges for the full year 2025. Ruben will share more details on the quarter and full year outlook in a few minutes. I do not want this near term volatility in retailer inventory destocking to detract from the bigger picture. As you have heard us say before, we have a category and portfolio advantage that positions us for long term success. As you can see on slide 4, the frozen category in Europe. remains healthy. Growth of the category slowed in 2024, but it has recently accelerated driven by improved volume and value gains and is once again outpacing the overall food market. We expect the category growth in the near term to remain choppy, especially in markets like the UK where industry wide promotion activity is being reduced to offset inflation. But we do believe the category's outperformance versus the overall food industry is a long term dynamic. The frozen category has outgrown the overall food industry by nearly 1 percentage point over the past decade and we are happy to see it resuming its leadership position. The The category continues to benefit from the secular trends of convenience, sustainability value and great tasting food. In fact, with the adoption of air fryers, we are increasingly able to deliver restaurant quality food from the freezer with lower preparation times and higher consumer satisfaction than prior preparation methods while saving consumers substantial money relative to the restaurant's alternative. We are excited about the long term growth opportunity in our category and we especially appreciate how our portfolio is positioned within it. As a reminder, 2/3 of our revenue is generated from lean proteins and vegetables and 94% of our UK and Western Europe revenue is generated from products deemed a healthy meal choice by the UK government. We believe we are well positioned to meet consumers evolving nutritional needs. We believe this portfolio advantage combined with our effective strategy and go to market playbook was a key contributor to the improved market share performance we achieved over the last six months of 2024. As you can see on Slide 5, these share gains have stalled in the first quarter of 2025, but this was largely as expected. As I mentioned earlier, many of our key growth initiatives are scheduled to begin the second quarter. These initiatives are centered around our mushroom battles, especially fish. While our investment behind our growth platforms has continued at a steady pace and that investment is paying off, net sales for our growth platforms rose 36% year over year in the first quarter. Chicken remains a success story for us and the team has also delivered impressive wins in other categories. In the UK for example, we now have a nearly 2% share of the frozen chip market versus 0% this time. Last year. In Germany, we have doubled our retail sales of prepared meals year on year. In the first quarter. We will continue to invest behind these growth platforms to keep our momentum going, but at the same time we will not lose focus on our must win battles. So let's pivot to our acceleration plans behind our mushroom battles. We have exciting plans to drive growth behind all our mushroom battles, but I'm especially excited about the new news we have this year to grow our core fish portfolio. FISH is critical to our success. It accounts for a third of our revenue and is margin accretive. We are fortunate that this nutrition profile plays so well into the evolving consumer nutritional demands. As a nutrient rich source of lean protein that tastes great, it is our job to ensure that it remains exciting and top of mind for consumers and we have a fully integrated playbook designed to do just that, starting with advertising. Later this year we will be launching a new master brand advertising campaign that reinforces the taste appeal and positive nutrition profile of our frozen food brands. And of course our fish portfolio will be one of the stars in the campaign. As these ads are airing, we will simultaneously be executing impactful merchandising activity to drive impulse purchases at retail while ensuring the optimal value equation for consumers and we are investing in our products. Renovation plays an important role. We are committed to always delivering the best quality and are currently investing in renovating our Fish fingers to deliver more taste, more crunch, more delight. These new improved products will be rolling out through this year. Innovation is also a critical part of the plan and we have a long history of developing better tasting, more appetizing offerings that are proven to drive consumer demand. We remain on track to increase our innovation as a percentage of sales ratio again in 2025 and fish is an important part of this plan. On slide 6 you can see the new Captain's Discovery line that has recently launched in the uk. These products are anchored in flavor, excitement and help us keep our portfolio modern with great tasting products and new varieties for consumers to spice up their dinner. Also on this slide you can see our Fish Bar sub brand of products that we relaunched in Italy last year.. Italy is an interesting case study for us. This time last year the country management team was embarking on the same path that we are now pursuing across many markets. They sought to accelerate fish growth with a playbook very similar to what I have been describing. Our Italian team leaned in with a fully integrated plan. Strong media investment was overlaid with impactful merchandising events that hit relevant price points while being integrated with thematical promotions such as our Playmobil event and it was supported by both renovation and innovation behind Office Basa brand. You can see some of these products on this slide and results speak for themselves. Growth improved for both S&O categories. Retail sales for office products accelerated to 6% in Italy in the fourth quarter of last year and rose 9% in the first quarter of this year. And while we're gaining share, we are also supporting category growth which is up 6% so far this year. Fish Bar has been a meaningful contributor to this growth and the brand is helping us expand category consumption with offerings for a snack or mini meal, occasion occasions where fish and especially fish fingers has not historically been considered an attractive option. We are seeing the brand's buy rate among existing fish consumers grow while at the same time Fish Bar is attracting new consumers new consumers to the category. We are growing penetration with younger and higher income consumers. We are breathing new life and relevance into fish fingers in Italy and I'm excited to see what we can accomplish in other markets this year. So while the environment is not easy and we are facing some headwinds, we have a lot to look forward to. We are confident that organic sales will return to growth beginning in the second quarter and we expect to achieve profitable growth for the remainder of the year and beyond. With that, let me turn it to Ruben to take you through our results and outlook in more detail."},{"end_time":"1248140","segment_id":6,"speaker":"Ruben","start_time":"883310","text":"Ruben thank you Stefan and good morning everyone. Let me get right into the results. As you can see on slides 7 and 8 for the first quarter reported net revenues decreased by 3% to 760 million euros. Organic sales declined 3.6% with volume declining -3.7% while price mix inflected into slight positive territory. Retail sell through though was slightly positive in the quarter at 0.2% which means that our sell in let sell through but nearly 4 percentage points in the quarter. We believe that the later timing of Easter this year accounted for roughly 1 percentage point of the gap and we expect to recover that in the second quarter. We attribute the remainder of the gap to retailer inventory destocking which was greater than we had expected. We believe that retailers are likely to keep inventory levels at this now lower level. As a result, we do not expect to benefit from retailers building inventory backup in the future. Despite the top line deleverage in the quarter, we were pleased to grow our gross margin by 90 basis points year-on-year to 27.8%. Productivity savings from our supply chain team contributed to the gross margin expansion as did lapping and negative inventory revaluation. Headwind in 1Q24 moving down the P&L adjusted operating expenses rose 3% year on year in the first quarter. This was entirely driven by a double digit increase in amp. In fact, our overhead expense modestly contracted year on year despite underlying inflation. Over the past two years we have made meaningful investments in areas such as cybersecurity and revenue growth management capabilities. With these capabilities now established, we have begun to drive inefficiencies out of our overhead expenses. We were happy to see these efforts begin to drive returns this quarter, but despite these savings, our adjusted EBITDA decreased 1.8% year on year to 120 million euro while adjusted EPS fell 5.4% to 35 Euro cents. Given the net sales contraction. Turning to cash flow on Slide 9, higher working capital pressured free cash flow in the quarter, causing our adjusted free cash flow conversion ratio as a percentage of after tax profits to fall to 24%. The primary driver of the unfavorable working capital was higher finished goods inventories. We produced product for Easter in the quarter, but those did not ship until the second quarter. The greater than expected retailer inventory destocking also contributed to higher inventory levels. Given the associated sales shortfall, neither of these dynamics should have an impact on the full year cash flow. Turning to Use of Cash as Stefan mentioned, we continue to return cash to shareholders. In the first quarter we repurchased roughly 49 million euros of shares while paying out slightly more than 25 million euro dividends. The collective return of nearly 75 million euros were 152% higher than 1Q24 and last week we declared a quarterly dividend of $17, which is 13% higher than the same dividend last year. Turning to our guidance for 2025 on Slide 10, as I previously mentioned, we do not expect to recover the sales we lost in the first quarter due to retailer inventory destocking. In addition, the macro uncertainty has caused us to risk adjust our forecast further, especially in the UK where the category is cycling a tough comparison in the second quarter and where we are seeing some downtrending from consumers. As a result, we have lowered a full year organic sales growth outlook to 0 to 2% growth versus our prior outlook of 1 to 3% growth on top of the lower sales outlook. We also now foresee slightly more cost pressure coming from some of our input costs. We expect to be able to offset much of these higher costs with incremental pricing. As those of you who have followed us for a while know, we have a long track record of successfully taking price to recover cost increases. We expect these increases will take time to implement and the cost price lag is likely to result in gross margin pressure. In the near term. We have the flexibility within our PNL to offset the impact of the incremental cost pressure and slightly lower sales growth by curtailing some of our investments in our brands and product renovations. But we are focused on ensuring that we continue to invest in the long term health of our business. As a result, we are lowering our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance to 0 to + 2% year on year growth from a prior outlook of + 2 to 4% growth. The impact of the lower EBITDA outlook is partially offset at the EPS line per share repurchases. As a result, we have widened our EPS growth outlook at the low end resulting in a range of plus 2 to 6% growth versus our prior outlook of plus 4 to 6% growth. This equates to \u20ac1.82 to \u20ac1.89 or $2.07 to $2.15 at recent exchange rates. Turning to free cash flow, we continue to expect a conversion ratio of 90% or greater as we expect the timing related headwinds to cash flow in the first quarter to reverse throughout the year. All in while we face some incremental headwinds that we had not expected at the start of the year, we continue to feel good about the underlying health of our business. Our flywheel is working and we have compelling and well funded marketing, merchandising, innovation and renovation plan scheduled for the remainder of the year. We expect these plans to drive resumed top line growth beginning in the second quarter and sustain improved momentum throughout the remainder of the year. While the macro environment has become increasingly uncertain, we believe that our updated outlook affords us the flexibility to navigate incremental headwinds should they arise. With that, I will now turn the call back to the operator to open the line for questions."},{"end_time":"1281640","segment_id":7,"speaker":"UNKNOWN","start_time":"1249820","text":"Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press Star then one on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. If at any time your question has been addressed and you would like to withdraw your question, please press Star then two. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. The first question comes from Scott Marks with Jeffrey. Please go ahead."},{"end_time":"1313470","segment_id":8,"speaker":"Scott Marks","start_time":"1283960","text":"Hey, good morning guys. Thanks so much for taking our questions this morning. First question for me is. Good morning. First question for me. You know the retailer D stock that you mentioned? I know we've heard, you know, a lot about that. I think here in the US maybe not as much in Europe. So just wondering if you can kind of share some color on that in terms of, you know, were there any particular countries or any specific categories of yours where you saw more of an impact?"},{"end_time":"1366420","segment_id":9,"speaker":"Stephan","start_time":"1316430","text":"Yeah, thank you, Scott. That was indeed an impact we've seen in the quarter. Having said that, you know, we had already, before the quarter saw some phasing between, you know, New Year and the old year. So we already said, look, we expect the quarter to be a bit soft, but it was more so than we expected. And back to your question, it was quite broad based. So in most of our countries we've seen that we're tracking 15 countries and I would say 13, 12 to 13 of those countries we've seen a destocking. It was also quite broad based, you know, across segments and also across must win battles. We, you know we do track stock. We have actually now also on tracking of stock, look at muslin battles. So we think also that vast amount of this destocking is now behind us. Maybe one or two markets like potentially the UK but that's what we've seen. So it was broad based."},{"end_time":"1378580","segment_id":10,"speaker":"Stephan","start_time":"1367460","text":"It was broad based. It was also not limited to December. January took us a bit later in the quarter which was probably the part that was unexpected."},{"end_time":"1407040","segment_id":11,"speaker":"Scott Marks","start_time":"1382420","text":"Understood, thanks for that. And then I guess with the new revised outlook for the year, wondering if you can just kind of speak to expectations for category growth. I know you talked about still healthy category, maybe a little choppy given some of the macro uncertainty, but just wondering if you can update us on your outlook for category growth and your market share performance within it for the year. Thanks so much."},{"end_time":"1489070","segment_id":12,"speaker":"Stephan","start_time":"1409760","text":"Well, the thing is To your point, I think the category remains healthy, which is really good news for us. To your point, I think we have slightly reduced our top line which means that by the way, as a result with the starting point, yes we will need, we obviously will grow in the next quarters and we'll grow market share as well. That's the point. I think what we've seen is interesting to see is after probably a slightly more difficult quarter in terms of market share., Q4 is starting to P4, sorry is now slightly positive in terms of value and definitely 0.3% in volume. So which is good news for us I think. The only thing is we know, we think it's going to take a bit more time in the UK because basically you have also a lot of promo in Q2 so last year. So it's basically the comps are more difficult. And the second something we need to also take into account for the near future is last year Q2 Adriatic, the weather was fantastic and as you know we have a part of our business is the ice cream. We love it but definitely something we can't plan the same way. But overall, by the way, the ice cream business remains extremely healthy."},{"end_time":"1518440","segment_id":13,"speaker":"Stephan","start_time":"1489310","text":"Yeah. And just to build on that. So again, you know, as we said before, this remains a strong category has outperformed Total Foods in Europe by more than 1%. If you look at more in the longer term, if you look at the kind of year to date we see categories like Gold Feed continues to grow very well. We see fish relatively strong growth in the line, around 1 to 1.5%. So that's also Good. But back to Stefan's point, a lot of countries are growing. We see some softness in the UK also in P4 and then a bit of the ice."},{"end_time":"1545320","segment_id":14,"speaker":"Stephan","start_time":"1518440","text":"We start with the comparables. Also important to know that we knew from the start that when we see, let's say the quantity of activation programs in terms of innovation, innovation and also obviously at the store level and in terms of price was very much more in second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter as opposed to first quarter. So we knew from the start that first quarter was probably the softest quarter of the year."},{"end_time":"1551080","segment_id":15,"speaker":"Scott Marks","start_time":"1549000","text":"Understood. I'll pass it on. Thanks so much."},{"end_time":"1560120","segment_id":16,"speaker":"UNKNOWN","start_time":"1554440","text":"Thank you. The next question comes from John Baumgartner with Mizoho. Please go ahead."},{"end_time":"1585800","segment_id":17,"speaker":"John Baumgartner","start_time":"1562040","text":"Good morning. Thanks for the question. Maybe to stick with the destocking, you're looking at the Nielsen data, the volumes for the quarter, the categories didn't look too bad. Do you have a sense that it's working capital related or is retailers sort of bracing for incremental weakness going forward? It just, it didn't seem to align with the measure channel data and maybe it's Nomad specific, any color on that front."},{"end_time":"1633300","segment_id":18,"speaker":"Ruben","start_time":"1590620","text":"So we've seen. So just if you take a step back also to understand this quarter, we grew in the quarter in sell out with plus 0.2% in sell out. We did, as you also have seen in the presentation, lost market share in certain categories. Some of that was expected in terms of phasing of activities. But we did see that our sellout has been less than the total category. And to Stefan's point, we see the Recovery now in P4 with this context that UK's the overall market is a bit more soft and we see ice cream. So we did have a difference between us and the category in the quarter and the big difference on the plus 0.2 and what the sell in minus 3.6. A big part of that is vast majority of that is destocking in our categories."},{"end_time":"1664840","segment_id":19,"speaker":"John Baumgartner","start_time":"1634260","text":"Okay, thanks Reuben. And then you know, to follow up in terms of the new products, the innovation, the new geographies you mentioned, you're pulling new consumers both new to the category, new to the brand. I'm curious at this point if you have enough information on that, Do you have a sense as to number one, where your consumers are shifting from? Is it from smaller brands or from private label? And then number two, for those consumers new to the category, are those consumers coming to the category from different temperature states like fresh produce, fresh fish or is it from other frozen categories?"},{"end_time":"1755650","segment_id":20,"speaker":"Stephan","start_time":"1668190","text":"Well, the thing is it's Interesting, you know, you know that we very, very strong, John, in terms of family meal time. And I think it was what we're seeing right now. And it's very interesting. A lot of innovations, even to some extent, our innovations are going more and more to the snacking side. And we as leader in the category, we believe, you know, that frozen food can play a fantastic role in terms of snacking. So we've seen, for example in Belgium, that's interesting to see. We have a lot of SKUs and we put them together as a category in terms of snacking. So no real innovation. Just put them together. It's working extremely well. Second piece is, well, you know, we have fish fingers, which is really the iconic family meal time across Europe. Now we're moving to what we call fish bar, which is much more a snacking occasion. And we starting in Italy and it's doing extremely well. So we know that there is a space to begin for us in that category independently from where they're coming from first within frozen, but also from obviously from chilled and from ambient. But definitely for us it's a white space and it's a wide space where we have all the intent to gain over time starting now. But definitely you will hear more about snacking and informal eating, whatever the denomination, in the coming quarters."},{"end_time":"1782890","segment_id":21,"speaker":"Ruben","start_time":"1755810","text":"And to build on what Stefan said, we've proven to do that in Italy where actually with chicken we've been able to grow the total frozen food category really came as growth on top for the retail as well. And we're making step, for example, with secondary placement of frozen food freezers next to chilled to drive that conversion. I mean, that will be step by step. It's not that we can do that on a massive amount in Europe, but we're making those steps to drive total category growth and transferring consumers from other countries into."},{"end_time":"1805620","segment_id":22,"speaker":"Stephan","start_time":"1783050","text":"And if you're adding, you know, air fryer, where the penetration in Europe is huge right now, in the UK I think it's 80%. So it's really big and utilization rate is really high as well. That's definitely the kind of thing that does well for for frozen food. So this combination of things, you know, definitely we want to invest in snacking, and we think we have the right to play there and to win."},{"end_time":"1807940","segment_id":23,"speaker":"John Baumgartner","start_time":"1806740","text":"Great.

Please go ahead."},{"end_time":"1843080","segment_id":26,"speaker":"John Tanwan Thang","start_time":"1826240","text":"Hi, good morning and thank you for taking my questions. You guys Mentioned being able to adjust. Hi Stefan, you mentioned being able to adjust the intensity of your, of your brand and A&P investment. To be clear, is that included in your guidance already or is it just a lever to pull if you see incremental headwind?"},{"end_time":"1889980","segment_id":27,"speaker":"Stephan","start_time":"1843080","text":"At this point, it's included in our guidance to make it very simple so we keep the good job. You know, I think it's. Obviously there is sometimes a bit more pressure but definitely, you know, we are brand builders so we want to keep it that way. But again, you know, we shouldn't limit it to amp. I think it's a combination of different things. You know, you've seen what obviously our cycle is, you know, 360 approach. So amp is part of it, but definitely, you know, it's part of it, but it's not. It's. It's a combination of A&P for sometimes price investments, renovation in some categories, innovation in others. So it's a lot of things but definitely A&P plays an important role and we have all the intent to keep investing."},{"end_time":"1902780","segment_id":28,"speaker":"John Tanwan Thang","start_time":"1891980","text":"Okay, great, thank you. And then just any more color on where your inputs are increasing? Is that a trade or tariff or currency issue or is it something else specific to a specific input?"},{"end_time":"1958480","segment_id":29,"speaker":"Ruben","start_time":"1904790","text":"No, that is not. Thanks for the question. That's not a tariff impact by the way. Also on that point, we're not impacted by tariff. You never know what happens in the future. But this moment we don't see that. We might have more medium long term impacts but also death. At the moment we don't see the impact we're seeing as much on proteins. So it's in chicken and in red meat. And part of that is demand for proteins. Part of that is also that we've seen in Europe avian flu on the poultry side impacting us. And as we said, you know, just when going through the presentation, this company has proven to have the pricing power and have taken quite some pricing in the past. But you know, we've also chosen not to go into big clashes with trade here also because this inflation was creeping up in the last couple of months. So we will take pricing but a lot of this higher inflation will be compensated next year."},{"end_time":"1961430","segment_id":30,"speaker":"John Tanwan Thang","start_time":"1960470","text":"Okay, great.

Just wanted to follow up on the question of being able to pass pricing through. You mentioned the consumers were trading down a little bit as well. At the same time, I'm wondering if there's maybe a little bit more elasticity in your ability to price, as you look forward, number one. And number two, just if you have any color on what the private labels and the discounters are doing, that would be helpful as well."},{"end_time":"2071390","segment_id":33,"speaker":"Stephan","start_time":"2015090","text":"Well, I think to your point, I think when the situation is a bit volatile, uncertain, you know, I think directly back to Reuben's point, I think people obviously are looking a bit more for value, I mean, thinking obviously price as opposed to anything else at the same time. Well, as I said, you know, we are back to a stable to slightly positive market share in P4, which is good news. And our job is obviously to find the right equation. So sometimes there will be price investments. We did it last year for example in Italy in fish. But that was a combination of many different things. Most of the time we never go for any price. It's going to be a combination obviously of renovation of obviously a new advertising campaign together obviously with in store activation. So that's the kind of things we're going to do. And as I said, you know."},{"end_time":"2073470","segment_id":34,"speaker":"Stephan","start_time":"2073230","text":"I."},{"end_time":"2089870","segment_id":35,"speaker":"Stephan","start_time":"2073470","text":"Think what we see right now is yes, these charges have a bit of leeway during the first quarter.

So you've seen that in largely the buildup of volume and price we expect in quarter two. And we said before that quarter two there's this phasing of Easter,. We think that's around 1% already said, look, the growth of the market, we also see some softness in the UK and the start of the ice cream in April, which doesn't help on the margin mix. But we expect quarter two to be in the volume and then back to the point in pricing but also RGM activities that will kick in in the second half of the year. So we expect pricing, the growth in the second half to be more being built on price and quarter two more on volume."},{"end_time":"2146360","segment_id":38,"speaker":"Ruben","start_time":"2142840","text":"But overall on a full year basis it's going to be a combination of both.

Nomad Foods has Now entered its 10th year as a public company and the environment in which we celebrate our 10th anniversary is so far proving to be anything but boring. The good news is that we have built a resilient organization and portfolio that is willing to weather the current economic environment. Our leading brands remain healthy and as I will illustrate in a few moments, our category in Europe is strong. Furthermore, I remain confident in our strategy. Our commercial flywheel is spinning at a good rate, producing attractive innovation, impactful merchandising and compelling advertising. And while performance can be choppy month to month or even quarter to quarter, I think you will agree that the trend line of our underlying improvement highlights the strength of our business model and with that let me turn my attention to results on Slide 3. Our retail sell through rose modestly. in the quarter, which was in line with expectations. Recall last quarter that we guided to a slower start of the year given the timing of our growth initiatives as well as the later Easter this year. This largely played out as expected And. I'm pleased that our organization was able to deliver another quarter of gross margin expansion. This, as well as overweight savings that we are just now beginning to realize helped fund a double digit increase in ANP this quarter and our strong cash flow has allowed us to continue returning cash to shareholders and reinvesting our business. In fact, in the first quarter we repurchased 49 million euros of shares and paid our 25 million euros of dividends. This collective 74 million euros in the first quarter marks a 152% increase versus what we returned to shareholders in the first quarter last year. We have a lot to celebrate, but at the same time I recognize that our industry is facing headwinds to overcome. Our net sales, for example, lagged our sales through by a larger negative than expected amount in the first quarter as we face greater than expected retail inventory destocking across Europe. Meanwhile, we are seeing some increased value seeking behavior by consumers and our input cost outlook has modestly increased. We will offset this cost pressure with targeted pricing as we have successfully done in the past, but these increases will take time to fully implement and rather than curtail investment to mitigate some of these headwinds, we continue to invest behind our brands and products for the long term health of our business. Based on these factors, we believe it is prudent to lower our full year organic revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS growth ranges for the full year 2025. Ruben will share more details on the quarter and full year outlook in a few minutes. I do not want this near term volatility in retailer inventory destocking to detract from the bigger picture. As you have heard us say before, we have a category and portfolio advantage that positions us for long term success. As you can see on slide 4, the frozen category in Europe. remains healthy. Growth of the category slowed in 2024, but it has recently accelerated driven by improved volume and value gains and is once again outpacing the overall food market. We expect the category growth in the near term to remain choppy, especially in markets like the UK where industry wide promotion activity is being reduced to offset inflation. But we do believe the category's outperformance versus the overall food industry is a long term dynamic. The frozen category has outgrown the overall food industry by nearly 1 percentage point over the past decade and we are happy to see it resuming its leadership position. The The category continues to benefit from the secular trends of convenience, sustainability value and great tasting food. In fact, with the adoption of air fryers, we are increasingly able to deliver restaurant quality food from the freezer with lower preparation times and higher consumer satisfaction than prior preparation methods while saving consumers substantial money relative to the restaurant's alternative. We are excited about the long term growth opportunity in our category and we especially appreciate how our portfolio is positioned within it. As a reminder, 2/3 of our revenue is generated from lean proteins and vegetables and 94% of our UK and Western Europe revenue is generated from products deemed a healthy meal choice by the UK government. We believe we are well positioned to meet consumers evolving nutritional needs. We believe this portfolio advantage combined with our effective strategy and go to market playbook was a key contributor to the improved market share performance we achieved over the last six months of 2024. As you can see on Slide 5, these share gains have stalled in the first quarter of 2025, but this was largely as expected. As I mentioned earlier, many of our key growth initiatives are scheduled to begin the second quarter. These initiatives are centered around our mushroom battles, especially fish. While our investment behind our growth platforms has continued at a steady pace and that investment is paying off, net sales for our growth platforms rose 36% year over year in the first quarter. Chicken remains a success story for us and the team has also delivered impressive wins in other categories. In the UK for example, we now have a nearly 2% share of the frozen chip market versus 0% this time. Last year. In Germany, we have doubled our retail sales of prepared meals year on year. In the first quarter. We will continue to invest behind these growth platforms to keep our momentum going, but at the same time we will not lose focus on our must win battles. So let's pivot to our acceleration plans behind our mushroom battles. We have exciting plans to drive growth behind all our mushroom battles, but I'm especially excited about the new news we have this year to grow our core fish portfolio. FISH is critical to our success. It accounts for a third of our revenue and is margin accretive. We are fortunate that this nutrition profile plays so well into the evolving consumer nutritional demands. As a nutrient rich source of lean protein that tastes great, it is our job to ensure that it remains exciting and top of mind for consumers and we have a fully integrated playbook designed to do just that, starting with advertising. Later this year we will be launching a new master brand advertising campaign that reinforces the taste appeal and positive nutrition profile of our frozen food brands. And of course our fish portfolio will be one of the stars in the campaign. As these ads are airing, we will simultaneously be executing impactful merchandising activity to drive impulse purchases at retail while ensuring the optimal value equation for consumers and we are investing in our products. Renovation plays an important role. We are committed to always delivering the best quality and are currently investing in renovating our Fish fingers to deliver more taste, more crunch, more delight. These new improved products will be rolling out through this year. Innovation is also a critical part of the plan and we have a long history of developing better tasting, more appetizing offerings that are proven to drive consumer demand. We remain on track to increase our innovation as a percentage of sales ratio again in 2025 and fish is an important part of this plan. On slide 6 you can see the new Captain's Discovery line that has recently launched in the uk. These products are anchored in flavor, excitement and help us keep our portfolio modern with great tasting products and new varieties for consumers to spice up their dinner. Also on this slide you can see our Fish Bar sub brand of products that we relaunched in Italy last year.. Italy is an interesting case study for us. This time last year the country management team was embarking on the same path that we are now pursuing across many markets. They sought to accelerate fish growth with a playbook very similar to what I have been describing. Our Italian team leaned in with a fully integrated plan. Strong media investment was overlaid with impactful merchandising events that hit relevant price points while being integrated with thematical promotions such as our Playmobil event and it was supported by both renovation and innovation behind Office Basa brand. You can see some of these products on this slide and results speak for themselves. Growth improved for both S&O categories. Retail sales for office products accelerated to 6% in Italy in the fourth quarter of last year and rose 9% in the first quarter of this year. And while we're gaining share, we are also supporting category growth which is up 6% so far this year. Fish Bar has been a meaningful contributor to this growth and the brand is helping us expand category consumption with offerings for a snack or mini meal, occasion occasions where fish and especially fish fingers has not historically been considered an attractive option. We are seeing the brand's buy rate among existing fish consumers grow while at the same time Fish Bar is attracting new consumers new consumers to the category. We are growing penetration with younger and higher income consumers. We are breathing new life and relevance into fish fingers in Italy and I'm excited to see what we can accomplish in other markets this year. So while the environment is not easy and we are facing some headwinds, we have a lot to look forward to. We are confident that organic sales will return to growth beginning in the second quarter and we expect to achieve profitable growth for the remainder of the year and beyond. With that, let me turn it to Ruben to take you through our results and outlook in more detail. Ruben thank you Stefan and good morning everyone. Let me get right into the results. As you can see on slides 7 and 8 for the first quarter reported net revenues decreased by 3% to 760 million euros. Organic sales declined 3.6% with volume declining -3.7% while price mix inflected into slight positive territory. Retail sell through though was slightly positive in the quarter at 0.2% which means that our sell in let sell through but nearly 4 percentage points in the quarter. We believe that the later timing of Easter this year accounted for roughly 1 percentage point of the gap and we expect to recover that in the second quarter. We attribute the remainder of the gap to retailer inventory destocking which was greater than we had expected. We believe that retailers are likely to keep inventory levels at this now lower level. As a result, we do not expect to benefit from retailers building inventory backup in the future. Despite the top line deleverage in the quarter, we were pleased to grow our gross margin by 90 basis points year-on-year to 27.8%. Productivity savings from our supply chain team contributed to the gross margin expansion as did lapping and negative inventory revaluation. Headwind in 1Q24 moving down the P&L adjusted operating expenses rose 3% year on year in the first quarter. This was entirely driven by a double digit increase in amp. In fact, our overhead expense modestly contracted year on year despite underlying inflation. Over the past two years we have made meaningful investments in areas such as cybersecurity and revenue growth management capabilities. With these capabilities now established, we have begun to drive inefficiencies out of our overhead expenses. We were happy to see these efforts begin to drive returns this quarter, but despite these savings, our adjusted EBITDA decreased 1.8% year on year to 120 million euro while adjusted EPS fell 5.4% to 35 Euro cents. Given the net sales contraction. Turning to cash flow on Slide 9, higher working capital pressured free cash flow in the quarter, causing our adjusted free cash flow conversion ratio as a percentage of after tax profits to fall to 24%. The primary driver of the unfavorable working capital was higher finished goods inventories. We produced product for Easter in the quarter, but those did not ship until the second quarter. The greater than expected retailer inventory destocking also contributed to higher inventory levels. Given the associated sales shortfall, neither of these dynamics should have an impact on the full year cash flow. Turning to Use of Cash as Stefan mentioned, we continue to return cash to shareholders. In the first quarter we repurchased roughly 49 million euros of shares while paying out slightly more than 25 million euro dividends. The collective return of nearly 75 million euros were 152% higher than 1Q24 and last week we declared a quarterly dividend of $17, which is 13% higher than the same dividend last year. Turning to our guidance for 2025 on Slide 10, as I previously mentioned, we do not expect to recover the sales we lost in the first quarter due to retailer inventory destocking. In addition, the macro uncertainty has caused us to risk adjust our forecast further, especially in the UK where the category is cycling a tough comparison in the second quarter and where we are seeing some downtrending from consumers. As a result, we have lowered a full year organic sales growth outlook to 0 to 2% growth versus our prior outlook of 1 to 3% growth on top of the lower sales outlook. We also now foresee slightly more cost pressure coming from some of our input costs. We expect to be able to offset much of these higher costs with incremental pricing. As those of you who have followed us for a while know, we have a long track record of successfully taking price to recover cost increases. We expect these increases will take time to implement and the cost price lag is likely to result in gross margin pressure. In the near term. We have the flexibility within our PNL to offset the impact of the incremental cost pressure and slightly lower sales growth by curtailing some of our investments in our brands and product renovations. But we are focused on ensuring that we continue to invest in the long term health of our business. As a result, we are lowering our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance to 0 to + 2% year on year growth from a prior outlook of + 2 to 4% growth. The impact of the lower EBITDA outlook is partially offset at the EPS line per share repurchases. As a result, we have widened our EPS growth outlook at the low end resulting in a range of plus 2 to 6% growth versus our prior outlook of plus 4 to 6% growth. This equates to \u20ac1.82 to \u20ac1.89 or $2.07 to $2.15 at recent exchange rates. Turning to free cash flow, we continue to expect a conversion ratio of 90% or greater as we expect the timing related headwinds to cash flow in the first quarter to reverse throughout the year. All in while we face some incremental headwinds that we had not expected at the start of the year, we continue to feel good about the underlying health of our business. Our flywheel is working and we have compelling and well funded marketing, merchandising, innovation and renovation plan scheduled for the remainder of the year. We expect these plans to drive resumed top line growth beginning in the second quarter and sustain improved momentum throughout the remainder of the year. While the macro environment has become increasingly uncertain, we believe that our updated outlook affords us the flexibility to navigate incremental headwinds should they arise. With that, I will now turn the call back to the operator to open the line for questions. Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press Star then one on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. If at any time your question has been addressed and you would like to withdraw your question, please press Star then two. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. The first question comes from Scott Marks with Jeffrey. Please go ahead. Hey, good morning guys. Thanks so much for taking our questions this morning. First question for me is. Good morning. First question for me. You know the retailer D stock that you mentioned? I know we've heard, you know, a lot about that. I think here in the US maybe not as much in Europe. So just wondering if you can kind of share some color on that in terms of, you know, were there any particular countries or any specific categories of yours where you saw more of an impact? Yeah, thank you, Scott. That was indeed an impact we've seen in the quarter. Having said that, you know, we had already, before the quarter saw some phasing between, you know, New Year and the old year. So we already said, look, we expect the quarter to be a bit soft, but it was more so than we expected. And back to your question, it was quite broad based. So in most of our countries we've seen that we're tracking 15 countries and I would say 13, 12 to 13 of those countries we've seen a destocking. It was also quite broad based, you know, across segments and also across must win battles. We, you know we do track stock. We have actually now also on tracking of stock, look at muslin battles. So we think also that vast amount of this destocking is now behind us. Maybe one or two markets like potentially the UK but that's what we've seen. So it was broad based. It was broad based. It was also not limited to December. January took us a bit later in the quarter which was probably the part that was unexpected. Understood, thanks for that. And then I guess with the new revised outlook for the year, wondering if you can just kind of speak to expectations for category growth. I know you talked about still healthy category, maybe a little choppy given some of the macro uncertainty, but just wondering if you can update us on your outlook for category growth and your market share performance within it for the year. Thanks so much. Well, the thing is To your point, I think the category remains healthy, which is really good news for us. To your point, I think we have slightly reduced our top line which means that by the way, as a result with the starting point, yes we will need, we obviously will grow in the next quarters and we'll grow market share as well. That's the point. I think what we've seen is interesting to see is after probably a slightly more difficult quarter in terms of market share., Q4 is starting to P4, sorry is now slightly positive in terms of value and definitely 0.3% in volume. So which is good news for us I think. The only thing is we know, we think it's going to take a bit more time in the UK because basically you have also a lot of promo in Q2 so last year. So it's basically the comps are more difficult. And the second something we need to also take into account for the near future is last year Q2 Adriatic, the weather was fantastic and as you know we have a part of our business is the ice cream. We love it but definitely something we can't plan the same way. But overall, by the way, the ice cream business remains extremely healthy. Yeah. And just to build on that. So again, you know, as we said before, this remains a strong category has outperformed Total Foods in Europe by more than 1%. If you look at more in the longer term, if you look at the kind of year to date we see categories like Gold Feed continues to grow very well. We see fish relatively strong growth in the line, around 1 to 1.5%. So that's also Good. But back to Stefan's point, a lot of countries are growing. We see some softness in the UK also in P4 and then a bit of the ice. We start with the comparables. Also important to know that we knew from the start that when we see, let's say the quantity of activation programs in terms of innovation, innovation and also obviously at the store level and in terms of price was very much more in second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter as opposed to first quarter. So we knew from the start that first quarter was probably the softest quarter of the year. Understood. I'll pass it on. Thanks so much. Thank you. The next question comes from John Baumgartner with Mizoho. Please go ahead. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Maybe to stick with the destocking, you're looking at the Nielsen data, the volumes for the quarter, the categories didn't look too bad. Do you have a sense that it's working capital related or is retailers sort of bracing for incremental weakness going forward? It just, it didn't seem to align with the measure channel data and maybe it's Nomad specific, any color on that front. So we've seen. So just if you take a step back also to understand this quarter, we grew in the quarter in sell out with plus 0.2% in sell out. We did, as you also have seen in the presentation, lost market share in certain categories. Some of that was expected in terms of phasing of activities. But we did see that our sellout has been less than the total category. And to Stefan's point, we see the Recovery now in P4 with this context that UK's the overall market is a bit more soft and we see ice cream. So we did have a difference between us and the category in the quarter and the big difference on the plus 0.2 and what the sell in minus 3.6. A big part of that is vast majority of that is destocking in our categories. Okay, thanks Reuben. And then you know, to follow up in terms of the new products, the innovation, the new geographies you mentioned, you're pulling new consumers both new to the category, new to the brand. I'm curious at this point if you have enough information on that, Do you have a sense as to number one, where your consumers are shifting from? Is it from smaller brands or from private label? And then number two, for those consumers new to the category, are those consumers coming to the category from different temperature states like fresh produce, fresh fish or is it from other frozen categories? Well, the thing is it's Interesting, you know, you know that we very, very strong, John, in terms of family meal time. And I think it was what we're seeing right now. And it's very interesting. A lot of innovations, even to some extent, our innovations are going more and more to the snacking side. And we as leader in the category, we believe, you know, that frozen food can play a fantastic role in terms of snacking. So we've seen, for example in Belgium, that's interesting to see. We have a lot of SKUs and we put them together as a category in terms of snacking. So no real innovation. Just put them together. It's working extremely well. Second piece is, well, you know, we have fish fingers, which is really the iconic family meal time across Europe. Now we're moving to what we call fish bar, which is much more a snacking occasion. And we starting in Italy and it's doing extremely well. So we know that there is a space to begin for us in that category independently from where they're coming from first within frozen, but also from obviously from chilled and from ambient. But definitely for us it's a white space and it's a wide space where we have all the intent to gain over time starting now. But definitely you will hear more about snacking and informal eating, whatever the denomination, in the coming quarters. And to build on what Stefan said, we've proven to do that in Italy where actually with chicken we've been able to grow the total frozen food category really came as growth on top for the retail as well. And we're making step, for example, with secondary placement of frozen food freezers next to chilled to drive that conversion. I mean, that will be step by step. It's not that we can do that on a massive amount in Europe, but we're making those steps to drive total category growth and transferring consumers from other countries into. And if you're adding, you know, air fryer, where the penetration in Europe is huge right now, in the UK I think it's 80%. So it's really big and utilization rate is really high as well. That's definitely the kind of thing that does well for for frozen food. So this combination of things, you know, definitely we want to invest in snacking, and we think we have the right to play there and to win. Great. Thanks for your time. You're welcome. Thanks, John. Thank you again. If you have a question, please press star then one. The next question comes from John Tanwan Thang with CJS Securities. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning and thank you for taking my questions. You guys Mentioned being able to adjust. Hi Stefan, you mentioned being able to adjust the intensity of your, of your brand and A&P investment. To be clear, is that included in your guidance already or is it just a lever to pull if you see incremental headwind? At this point, it's included in our guidance to make it very simple so we keep the good job. You know, I think it's. Obviously there is sometimes a bit more pressure but definitely, you know, we are brand builders so we want to keep it that way. But again, you know, we shouldn't limit it to amp. I think it's a combination of different things. You know, you've seen what obviously our cycle is, you know, 360 approach. So amp is part of it, but definitely, you know, it's part of it, but it's not. It's. It's a combination of A&P for sometimes price investments, renovation in some categories, innovation in others. So it's a lot of things but definitely A&P plays an important role and we have all the intent to keep investing. Okay, great, thank you. And then just any more color on where your inputs are increasing? Is that a trade or tariff or currency issue or is it something else specific to a specific input? No, that is not. Thanks for the question. That's not a tariff impact by the way. Also on that point, we're not impacted by tariff. You never know what happens in the future. But this moment we don't see that. We might have more medium long term impacts but also death. At the moment we don't see the impact we're seeing as much on proteins. So it's in chicken and in red meat. And part of that is demand for proteins. Part of that is also that we've seen in Europe avian flu on the poultry side impacting us. And as we said, you know, just when going through the presentation, this company has proven to have the pricing power and have taken quite some pricing in the past. But you know, we've also chosen not to go into big clashes with trade here also because this inflation was creeping up in the last couple of months. So we will take pricing but a lot of this higher inflation will be compensated next year. Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you. Anyone who wishes to ask a question, please press Star. Then one. We have a follow up question from John Tan, one thang with CJS Securities. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks for the follow up. Just wanted to follow up on the question of being able to pass pricing through. You mentioned the consumers were trading down a little bit as well. At the same time, I'm wondering if there's maybe a little bit more elasticity in your ability to price, as you look forward, number one. And number two, just if you have any color on what the private labels and the discounters are doing, that would be helpful as well. Well, I think to your point, I think when the situation is a bit volatile, uncertain, you know, I think directly back to Reuben's point, I think people obviously are looking a bit more for value, I mean, thinking obviously price as opposed to anything else at the same time. Well, as I said, you know, we are back to a stable to slightly positive market share in P4, which is good news. And our job is obviously to find the right equation. So sometimes there will be price investments. We did it last year for example in Italy in fish. But that was a combination of many different things. Most of the time we never go for any price. It's going to be a combination obviously of renovation of obviously a new advertising campaign together obviously with in store activation. So that's the kind of things we're going to do. And as I said, you know. I. Think what we see right now is yes, these charges have a bit of leeway during the first quarter. But you know, as far as we are concerned, you know, we're back on track in terms of market share and slightly positive in terms of volume, market share. Okay, great. Thank you. Just in the outlook, the updated outlook with you know, the 0 to 2% organic growth, is there any specific expectation for volume versus price in there? Yeah. So you've seen that in largely the buildup of volume and price we expect in quarter two. And we said before that quarter two there's this phasing of Easter,. We think that's around 1% already said, look, the growth of the market, we also see some softness in the UK and the start of the ice cream in April, which doesn't help on the margin mix. But we expect quarter two to be in the volume and then back to the point in pricing but also RGM activities that will kick in in the second half of the year. So we expect pricing, the growth in the second half to be more being built on price and quarter two more on volume. But overall on a full year basis it's going to be a combination of both. Yeah, definitely. Okay, great. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. This concludes our question and answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Stephan Deshumaker for any closing remarks. Thank you, operator. So, yeah, I'm proud of the progress our company has made. Over the past nine years and confident that we are on track to deliver another relatively strong year in 2025. Our strategy is working and our teams have developed compelling plans to deliver improved growth for the remainder of this year.

I'm happy to report that Nomad Foods had a strong finish to 2024 with impressive volume driven organic sales growth and robust margin expansion. Before I go too deep into results, I want to step back and reflect on where we are in our journey. As you can see on slide 3, we have now delivered nine consecutive years of sales and adjusted EBITDA growth. While this growth has been aided by M&A, organic growth has also been a strong and consistent contributor to this growth over time. In fact, in 2016 we have grown our organic sales at a nearly 3% target with growth in every year other than 2021 when we had the COVID demand spike. We are now entering our 10th year as a public company and are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth, including another year of organic growth in 2025. While generating considerable shareholder value, we have created an enviable company. Since embarking on this journey in 2015, we have assembled a portfolio of iconic brands with superior equity and strong market share positions and we have accomplished this while remaining focused building a pure play frozen food business that now spans both developed and developing markets across Europe. And we have acted with purpose, creating a portfolio of high quality, great tasting, convenient food that is good value and good for you. Roughly 2/3 of our portfolio is comprised of vegetables, fish and poultry and 93% of our European Western European revenue is generated from products deemed a healthy meal choice by the UK Government. And we've done this in a responsible way. I'm happy to share that Nomad Foods has been including the annual Dow Jones Sustainability Europe index for the fourth consecutive year while receiving a maximum score of 100 in health and nutrition for the sixth consecutive year. We are well positioned for the trends that are reshaping this industry. We have a clear portfolio advantage and we also have a people advantage. In recent years we have reshaped the organization. We have rewired how we work to improve efficiency, agility and ID sharing. We have upgraded our talent pool by promoting high performers from within while selectively hiring externally to fill knowledge and capability gaps where necessary. This has helped us own or strategy, energize organization and improve our execution. And lastly, we've been able to lean in and arm our team with the fuel they need to fund our strategy and initiatives. Our supply chain organization has delivered meaningful productivity over the past two years, while our strategic focus on driving growth in our profitable investment battles and growth platforms is delivering margin mix benefits that have allowed us to increase investment in our products or advertising in your in store merchandising while building capabilities in areas such as revenue growth management and cyber security among others. Given all of this, I feel great about how we positioned as we enter our 10th year as a public company and I'm confident we will deliver our 10th consecutive year of top and bottom line growth in 2025. Recent results only emboldened my confidence in this. It became clear to us in 2023 that the period of outsized inflation induced revenue growth was nearing an end. We knew that growth would become more dependent on volume gains, market share expansion and effective revenue growth management initiatives. It was then that we introduced our new commercial flywheel and innovation framework while beginning to increase our investment in our products, advertising and merchandising. Our amp spend increased by 14% in 2023 and then again by high single digits last year to 4% of net sales. This places us in the top tier for PE group and we expect A and P growth to once again outpace sales growth in 2025 and I'm excited to share some of our new creative with you later this year. It is some of the best I have ever seen from Nomad Foods. Our innovation meanwhile jumped from 4.2% in 2023 to 4.8% in 2024 and we expect it to easily exceed 5% in 2025. And when we combine innovation with renovation, we expect our renewal rate or percentage of sales where our products are new or refreshed to double from high single digits in 2024 to mid to high teens in 2025, we are upgrading our food and packaging to achieve superiority across an increasingly large percentage of our business. All of this is helping our commercial flywheel to spin faster and faster while delivering solid returns. As you can see on slide 5, we have now delivered three consecutive quarters of Boeing growth. Growth can move around quarter to quarter, so the trend line is clearly in the right direction. And while it helps that our European frozen food category is hefty and they are controlling much of our own destiny, although investments are supporting category growth while driving share growth, as you can see on slide 6, we have now achieved market share growth in each of the last two quarters and impressively, we accomplished this by expanding our gross margin. In fact, our gross margin in the last nine months of 2024 modestly exceeded the pre Covid level we achieved in 2019. Focus has been a key contributor to our success and focus will continue to define how we go to market in the future. We continue to concentrate a disproportionate amount of our time, energy and investment in our mushroom battles. These are the four category country combinations that are critically important to our success are margin accretive and where we have a clear right to win. The top 25 merchant backlogs accounted for more than half of our sales last year and an even larger share of our gross profit and grew net sales by 2.7% for the year and 3.5% in the quarter. While our focus remains on the upper midstream battles, recently we have been strategic investing behind select growth platforms. These are primarily areas where we see opportunities to leverage a capability in one market to extend our presence in another market. With a lift and launch approach. Our organic sales for growth platforms grew by 16% in 2024 and 40% in the fourth quarter. Over the past year we have been highlighting CaulFree. As one example, we have more than doubled our Call3 sales in the UK over the past five years and it has gone from a growth platform to a must win battle for us, even a success. Our goal is to make all of our growth platforms into machine battles over time. Italy and Germany are two more recent markets where we have made poultry into a growth platform seeking to replicate our success in the uk. The fraud and prepared poultry segment is underdeveloped in Italy and we began to invest in developing the segment there in early 2024. I'm happy to say that it is working. In the fourth quarter, our retail sales for prepared poultry in Italy rose 98% year on year with our market share growing from 8% in Q4 2023 to 50% in Q4 24. The category meanwhile is now growing 6% in Italy with Nomad accounting for more than 100% of the category growth. This is a great story for both us and our retail partners. In the back half of 2024 we turned our attention to Germany where the frozen prepared poultry market is large and well developed but dominated by private labor. Strategy is to create and premium teaser segment. I'm happy to say that we're finding success here too. It is early but in the fourth quarter our retail sales for prepared poultry rose 35% year on year. In Germany, we reached a 2.7% market share in the fourth quarter. That is 70 basis points higher than the prior year and illustrates how long the Runway could be for us in this market. The other growth platform we highlighted last year was potatoes. As a leading frozen fish company, it's only proper that we be a leading frozen chip company as well. In Belgium we already have a strong market share position on potatoes, but we are leaning in to make it even stronger and grow our market share by 420 basis points year on year four. And we're happy to report that we became the category lean and Belgium last year climbing from number two to number one in value share. In France, our share grew 550 basis points to 16.1% in the quarter. In the UK where the market is very large our share grew 70 basis points year on year to 8.9% a great accomplishment even if it's not keeping pace with the fantastic results in France and belgium. Turning to 2025, our playbook will not look meaningfully different. Our strategy is working and we will stay the course by championing frozen food. We will continue to focus on our investments now in our western battles and targeted growth platforms, but we will do it with more advertising, more innovation, more innovation and more revenue growth management initiatives. Ongoing productivity realization from across our organization is slowly investment growth allowing us to deliver balanced top and bottom line growth. And as has always been the case with no MyFood, we will deploy capital in ways that create value for shareholders and goes above and beyond organic growth. I'm excited to celebrate our 10th year as a public company with you in 2025. With that, let me turn it over to Ruben to tell you more about what we expect and provide some more detail on what we achieved last quarter."},{"end_time":"1324530","segment_id":3,"speaker":"Ruben","start_time":"843390","text":"Ruben thank you Stefan and good morning everyone. I've been with the company now for roughly eight months and I'm increasingly confident in the opportunities that lie ahead of us. We have an amazing portfolio in a great category with top tier talent and nutritional tailwinds at our back. Our playbook is working and the innovation, renovation and marketing plans we have to drive sustainable growth in 25 and beyond are compelling. Turning to Results as you can see on slide 7 and 9 for the fourth quarter reported net revenues increased by 4.3% to 793 million Euro. Organic growth was 3.1% which marked our tenth consecutive quarter of organic growth. Volume growth remained positive for the third consecutive quarter rising by an impressive 4.7% while price mix was a negative 1.6% offset to volume growth as we reinvested some of our margin upside to drive impactful merchandising at retail. The net price investment was an 80 basis point headwind to gross margin and was more than overcome by 40 basis points of favorable mix and 160 basis points of productivity thanks to efficiency gains. This quarter, Robust gross margin and healthy revenue growth delivered a 9% increase in gross profit which was amplified by a 2.6% year on year decrease in SGA expenses to result in a 17.6 increase increase in adjusted EBITDA. The lower SGA expense was driven by lower amp expenses as we lapped the sharp increase in prior year investment and benefited from a more even investment cadence throughout the year. AMP investment rose high single digits for the year on top of double digit increase in 2023. Indirect investment growth slowed to low single digits in the quarter as we began to cycle the capability investment that began in late 23 and carried through to 24. Adjusted profit rose 28% year on year while adjusted EPS rose 31% to \u20ac42 cents as our diluted share count shrunk 3% year on year. For the full year we delivered our ninth consecutive year of sales and adjusted EBITDA growth as you can See on slide 8 and 10 Full year revenue grew 1.8% with organic sales rising 1% as volume returned to growth gaining 1.3% year on year. Gross margin rose from 40 basis points for the year to 29.6, nearly reaching the 30% pre Covid gross margin we achieved in 2019. Investment in price and promotion was a 70 basis point year on year headwind to our full year gross margin which was more than offset by 110 basis points of favorable margin mix and 100 basis points of net productivity realized by our supply chain teams. Our teams have a robust pipeline of productivity initiatives and I expect these benefits to continue funding our growth investments going forward. Our SGA expenses grew 7.4% for the full year as we increased our A and P and indirect investments each by high single digit. The higher A and P was a continuation of the reinvestment plans that we started in 2023 and continued in 24. We expect even more reinvestments in 25. The higher indirect expense was due to a combination of underlying inflation and capability investment scenarios such as cyber security and revenue growth management. With these investments now behind us, we expect much more moderate growth in indirect expenses going forward. Despite these investments made in 2024, we were still able to grow our adjusted EBITDA by 5.6% for the year. We're living near the high end of our initial 4 to 6% EBITDA growth guidance range that we gave this time last year. Our full year EPS of \u20ac1.78 was also near the high end of our initial \u20ac175 to \u20ac1.80 range. Turning to cash flow now strong fourth quarter results helped us over deliver on our full year cash flow guidance with free cash flow conversion of 101% coming in well above our initial 90 to 95 conversion guidance. We saw nice working capital inflows in the fourth quarter due to the normal seasonal timing of inventory balances and an unwind of the higher receivable balances that were happened in the third quarter due to timing dynamics. The strong free cash flow allowed us to return 208 million euros to shareholders in 24. First at 171 million euros will be returned to shareholders in 23, therefore more than a 20% increase last year. We returned the cash in the form of a $60 cent per share annual dividend and share repurchases. We finished the year with 156.1 million basis shares outstanding, a 4% reduction from where we finished 2023 over the past two years. We've now repurchased 290 million euro of our shares. Turning to our guidance for 25 on slide 12, we are pleased with the progress our commercial team has made improving the market results and restoring our market share to growth and we are happy to see our supply chain team delivering healthy productivity savings. This gives us strong momentum in Q25 which will be our 10th year as public company and is also expected to be our 10th year of positive revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth. We continue to expect organic sales growth of 1 to 3% for the year and adjusted EBITDA growth of 2 to 4%. We had a stronger than expected finish to 2024 which means we now expect a higher absolute level of adjusted EBITDA and as a result we have raised our full year adjusted eps range to \u20ac1.85 to \u20ac1.89 from the initial \u20ac1.81 to \u20ac1.85. At recent exchange rates, this translates into US dollar denominated EPS of $1.94 to $1.98. And lastly, we continue to expect full year adjusted free cash flow conversion of at least 90%. We expect to use this cash flow to create incremental value for shareholders that goes above and beyond organic growth. Our still relatively new dividend is a great example of this. As you may have seen our announcement last month, our Board of Directors has approved a 30% increase in the first quarter 25 as dividends to $7 cents per share from the $15 cents quarterly payout in 2024. As we think about the shape of the year, we expect growth to be somewhat choppy quarter to quarter, even the phasing of investments, prior year comparisons and some seasonal movement. Nonetheless, we expect the underlying trend line of improvement to hold throughout the year in totality. While our advertising investment growth will be meaningful late quarter one, our new innovation fuel distribution gains and associated merchandising activity is expected to be more phased into quarter 2 and quarter 3 this year. This, in combination with Easter falling into quarter 2 this year versus quarter 1 last year will lead to revenue headwinds in the first quarter. At this moment. We therefore expect organic sales to modestly decline in quarter one. These are just timing dynamics and not a reflection of the underlying health of the business. In fact, while shipments are moving around, we are happy to see our retail sales growing in 1% to 2% range over the past two months despite the later phasing of our activity. Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we are making. We returned the business to profitable volume and market share driven growth last year and are confident that we can keep the momentum going in 2025. And with that I will now turn the call back to the operator to open the line for questions."},{"end_time":"1350540","segment_id":4,"speaker":"UNKNOWN","start_time":"1326700","text":"We will now begin the question and answer session.

Maybe to start off what is your 1 to 3% organic sales growth forecast for full year 25 predicated on with respect to your expectations for category growth and market share performance?"},{"end_time":"1456370","segment_id":9,"speaker":"Stephan","start_time":"1374980","text":"Well, as you may have seen, we, we are in the low inflation environment and we've come up with the 1% category growth as the first piece and the second piece is ourselves. Obviously overall, as we said, it's growing, but also very interestingly, our portfolio is really two. Third is poultry, fish, vegetables, which are growing very nicely. The commercial flywheel is working nicely. Innovation as we said, is around 5%. So the rest of the 1 to 3% is coming from this market share and mix and a bit of some net ERP. I would put it that way. Andrew. You remember that in Q3 we suffered of an ERP disruption in the UK, which is the biggest business for us. So obviously we keep going with ERP, which is the right thing to do. But this year, as we said, we decided to slow down the process, come up with a smaller part of the business and also all the lessons. So that's why I'm using the word net ERP. So will there be some disruption? Maybe much, much, much more limited than in Q, than Q3 last year. So that's where the 1 to 3% is coming from."},{"end_time":"1495410","segment_id":10,"speaker":"Andrew Lazar","start_time":"1457030","text":"Great. No, that's helpful. And then you mentioned in the fourth quarter you reinvested some of the upside in some of the sort of promotional activity, getting sort of distribution and some retail work and whatnot. And that obviously benefited volume pretty nicely as you move through the first quarter. I realize there's some impact on volume as you talked about, due to a later Easter and such. How would you expect sort of the price mix piece to come in now that you're two months through the first quarter? Would it be consistent on a year over year basis as an impact with what you saw in 4Q or more modest, do you think? Again, on the price mix side. Thanks so much."},{"end_time":"1513460","segment_id":11,"speaker":"Ruben","start_time":"1496370","text":"Yeah, let me answer that Andrew.

So you're absolutely right."},{"end_time":"1514620","segment_id":12,"speaker":"Ruben","start_time":"1513460","text":"If you look at the last three."},{"end_time":"1595930","segment_id":13,"speaker":"Ruben","start_time":"1514620","text":"Quarters, you've seen positive volume, especially in quarter four where we almost had 5% positive volume growth. And volume will remain important to us. It's important from a consumer perspective, retailer perspective, but also how it drives leverage in our factory. So we're not all overnight going to change that strategy where we drive efficiencies and reinvest that in volume. So that's one thing to the point of Stefan. So we've seen in the last two, three months lower inflation. And maybe that's also a separate question. If we look at kind of the full year and we're not fully hedged yet, but we might see a bit more inflation into this year, how that exactly plays out is still to be seen. But then we would need to take some pricing back. And again, if we see inflation and cost price, let's be absolutely clear, first of all, it's really to be cost competitive. So we continue all our efforts, we've done in terms of savings programs on procurement, continue to drive efficiencies in our factories, but also to drive efficiencies in indirect expenses. But there might be that a ladder is a remainder which we need to do with price. Now, how and when that price comes through is still to be seen. So, you know, at this moment, and you know, we've only had one month of actuals, we still see volume and a bit of pressure on price throughout the year. It could be that price comes back. So I think that is the context we can give you at this point."},{"end_time":"1597530","segment_id":14,"speaker":"Andrew Lazar","start_time":"1596810","text":"Thank you very much."},{"end_time":"1605130","segment_id":15,"speaker":"UNKNOWN","start_time":"1600570","text":"The next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.

Stephan, the stepped up innovation and renovation activity that you mentioned in your prepared remarks, I'm curious as to how much of that you expect to be focused on existing must win battles as opposed to some of the new and emerging growth platforms that you talked about in 25 and just how you think about striking that balance."},{"end_time":"1678380","segment_id":17,"speaker":"Stephan","start_time":"1632170","text":"Well, the thing is, to your point, it's going to be mostly growth, let's say must win battles and growth platforms. But let's say, let's put it that way, the must win battles are still very much the biggest piece of our business. So it's around 50% of our business and that's where the bulk of the innovation is going to go. This being said, at the same time, growth platform, which is let's say north of 100 million at this stage, is growing very nicely very fast. There's going to be a lot of list and launch, which is great. So it's going to be probably take proportionally a bigger part, but obviously applied on the smaller part of the business. But that's where the innovation is going to go first and foremost, must win battles, then obviously growth platforms."},{"end_time":"1704180","segment_id":18,"speaker":"Steve Powers","start_time":"1679700","text":"Okay, very good. And then you would also you talked about the organizational changes and the rewiring efforts that you've done to improve overall execution and agility, etc. To what extent do you feel that mission is sort of accomplished versus there being more work to do?

So my point is, no, it's never finished. But this being said, we have, I mean we have really simplified the organization big time last year. So you remember that we had, you know, at some stage, 22 countries and they're reporting a bit, you know, it was a bit, I wouldn't say it was optimal. Now we have all these guys reporting to one person, six clusters and I think it's a big, big change. In the meantime, we have obviously invested heavily in things like growth, like revenue growth management, innovation as well in service of obviously these clusters. Supply chain is really, it's a never ending process anyway, restructuring improvements, making sure that these savings are going to come back and then be in a position to invest behind the beyond A and P and gross margin ultimately. So my point is it's never finished. But let's say what we have accomplished last year was really meaningful. Now obviously we also have to remain very, very cost conscious because basically what I want to do to achieve is to put most of our, let's say savings behind A and P and innovation and then obviously in service of short term and long term ebitda. But that's how we want to be so lean in terms of indirect after having restructured and clarified the whole structure and then making sure that obviously our top line will be served the right way."},{"end_time":"1905820","segment_id":26,"speaker":"Steve Powers","start_time":"1903180","text":"Very good.

Please go ahead."},{"end_time":"1978990","segment_id":29,"speaker":"Rob Dickerson","start_time":"1915580","text":"Great, thanks so much. I guess maybe just first question on around gross margin. You know, I think about a year or so ago you kind of the, the idea was you can gradually get back right to the 30% gross margin range or somewhere around there, you know, really based on volume recovery also combined with just all the pro, the productivity initiatives and the, and the mix benefits, you know, as we think through kind of 25 relative 24. Your first question is like, seems like you're kind of already there, right? Like as you finish the full year 24, you're pretty close already. You know, is there, is there any kind of change to thinking in terms of like what the real gross margin benefit, you know, from here could be on the business just given really the focus on must win battles, given the volumes starting to recover, given the productivity initiatives? That's just the first question."},{"end_time":"2052560","segment_id":30,"speaker":"Ruben","start_time":"1978990","text":"Thank you. Yeah, let me answer that. Thanks for the question again. You know, our strategy will continue the same way and no change that we will continue. That's our commitment to drive efficiencies in supply chain. You've seen that in quarter four. In both the full year we had full year round, 100, 110 basis points of supply chain efficiencies. Quarter four we had supply chain efficiencies. We will continue to drive that. Right? And what we then said, we will reinvest those efficiencies together with our continued effort of driving mix into our brands and products. Now most of that will be an investment in amp and into the product, but it could also be that we do some investment in prices you have seen over the last three quarters. So that is our commitment. We're not, you know, at this moment going to say this is our guidance for gross margin in 25, whether that will be 30. We're very happy that you see the recovery in 24. We will continue to drive the drivers, but as I said also there will be a bit of inflation. Again, we need to be cost competitive. We have to take some prices and that will lead and we'll see how we then end with the gross margin. On the long term. I think we will continue to drive a further gross margin recovery. How it plays out in 25 is still to be seen."},{"end_time":"2124500","segment_id":31,"speaker":"Rob Dickerson","start_time":"2054550","text":"Okay, great, perfect. And then maybe just a bigger question for you, Stephan, just around kind of strategic opportunities, inorganic strategic opportunities and kind of where you sit now, you know, kind of, you know, for a long time Nomad was clearly, you know, acquiring a lot more actively. Lots occurred, you know, over the past three, four years that made that maybe a little bit more complicated, maybe valuations even a little lower. I'm just curious, kind of where you sit today. Are you more actively thinking about acquisition potential? If there were something that were to come up that were attractive, would you still consider that? Or are you maybe in a period right now such that the focus on the core portfolio really is primary number one initiative? And you really kind of think at some point we'll get back there. But right now we're really not thinking about acquisition potential at this point."},{"end_time":"2124900","segment_id":32,"speaker":"Rob Dickerson","start_time":"2124500","text":"That's all."},{"end_time":"2125620","segment_id":33,"speaker":"Rob Dickerson","start_time":"2124900","text":"Thanks so much."},{"end_time":"2262320","segment_id":34,"speaker":"Stephan","start_time":"2126260","text":"Thanks, Rob. Well, the point is, with or without acquisitions, Rob, the focus has always been, you know, the existing portfolio. That's the first piece we never deviated. You know, even when we did, you know, the Switzerland or Goodfellas or Aunt Bessie's or the Adriatics, we never deviated. That's the key piece. And that's the key piece because I don't think you can be a good acquirer if you're not doing the right job with your core business. Because the business model behind the acquisitions are always predicated on a very solid model, organic model. And that's why we never did any acquisitions between 15, 16, 17, because we had nothing to offer. We had first to clean up the whole thing, and then we started. So now, Obviously, since basically 2022, we stopped to your point because basically, first we need to focus on the business as such even more. That's one thing. And second, because there was a big difference between sellers and buyers, I think this is reducing the gap, is reducing a bit. In the meantime, no regret, we keep buying back shares, which is the best acquisitions we can do. But also at the same time, I think what we also see is there are some maybe under the radar screen things, not shiny objects that we could consider in our category, you know, new subcategories in some countries where we have a lot of synergies, and that's the kind of things more and more we are considering. Nothing done yet, but obviously I'm not in the business of disclosing any names that would be the smart thing to do. No guarantee to do anything, Rob, because if you guarantee something, that's the best way to make mistakes, by the way. But definitely we believe that we have something to offer which is not necessarily the big names in Europe, but others add ons deals. And I think by doing so we could create a nice pipeline of M and A. We're also creating a pipeline of innovation."},{"end_time":"2300190","segment_id":35,"speaker":"Ruben","start_time":"2263360","text":"And maybe just to build on that. And I can give credits to Stefan, I wasn't there. But since 2016, end of 2016, this business has deployed roughly 1.2 billion for M&A while shrinking the share count by 13%. 13%. And this combined with our organic growth, has allowed us to increase our ebitda per share by 97, almost 100%, nearly doubling it from 2016 to 2024. And we were doing this whilst you've seen the dividends and lowering our net debt to EBITDA leverage. So I think that also tells you something, in my humble opinion."},{"end_time":"2303710","segment_id":36,"speaker":"Rob Dickerson","start_time":"2301470","text":"Yeah, of course. Thank you so much.

Good morning. Good afternoon. Maybe first question, I wanted to come back to the Enterprise Wide transformation. The charges taken for that program in the quarter were fairly sizable. How far along are you in terms of taking these charges at this point, implementing the program? And then on the other side of that, how should we think about the ramp and the related efficiency benefits? I know it's not something you normally discuss in detail, but should that ramp in efficiencies begin in 2025, is it more 2026? Just any thoughts there?"},{"end_time":"2368780","segment_id":42,"speaker":"Ruben","start_time":"2351230","text":"Yeah, now let me answer that. It's a good question, John. So a couple points. You've seen that on the line. Yeah, maybe you can go, Jonathan. So the rent in terms of cost was around 5 million over the quarter."},{"end_time":"2369900","segment_id":43,"speaker":"Ruben","start_time":"2368780","text":"As well as if you look at."},{"end_time":"2449820","segment_id":44,"speaker":"Ruben","start_time":"2369900","text":"The last year, what we said before some interaction is we will bring that down, but clearly we're not all of a sudden going to halt that. But can we bring that down? These run rates with 20, 25%, that is clearly the aim and we should, we are working towards. That's one point. I think the other point is what Stefan said is to come to your question on efficiencies. The other point is what Stefan just said in terms of not having disruptions again, we will go slower, smaller and simpler and slower means one of the lessons is, you know, you need proper time to test it to onboard our teams and our people and our suppliers. That's one point. We will go smaller. So what we're going to put life at the end of this year, the current plan is that what we went live last year was around a third of our business. What we're going to put live this year is not even 15% of our business. So we will go smaller. And the third bit is where we're going to simplify. So that's the second point I want to bring in. The third point is the efficiency ramp up. There are elements related to the fact that you need a whole new enterprise system and that will help us. But the big efficiency gains in terms of What Stefan spoke about simplifying the organization in terms of factory optimization, both at a factory as well as on a macro level in terms of supplier rationalization. Nothing is stopping us to do that already. In the next quarter, in the next one or two years."},{"end_time":"2482700","segment_id":45,"speaker":"John Baumgartner","start_time":"2452460","text":"Okay, okay, great. Thanks for that. And then a follow up on the commentary on pricing. I'm curious as you sort of see the waves of material inflation having passed and you look back and assess how the volumes are evolving after the rebasing these higher price levels for the category, how do you think about everyday value for your frozen categories at this point? And do you sense that anything has changed in terms of maybe frost elasticities relative to fresh or shelf stable options for consumers in the categories?"},{"end_time":"2586650","segment_id":46,"speaker":"Stephan","start_time":"2484380","text":"Well, I think vis a vis, let's say the center store and obviously fresh, it's a bit more difficult to see. The only thing we see we've seen is during this crisis, as expected as category leader, we led the price increases and the other guys have been a bit slower to react, including the private label. So it's been a great time for private label in terms of market share, as expected by the way. But we have no regret because that was the right thing to do. I by far prefer back to, to Rob's question. Where do we stand with gross margin? I can tell you we wouldn't have this. We would not talk about whether you're going to go back to 30% that we would have been very far from that. Now what we see is at least in the category. John, I would put in the category. I think what we see is we are obviously we're regaining market share. It's a bit choppy still, but we're getting market share versus private level, which is good because the market, let's say the price has stabilized, which is the good news as well. Now back to your question and correct me if I'm wrong. How are we doing versus other categories like fresh or center store? Well, I think overall, I think it's more than ever frozen has proven to be a very resilient and good category. And I would say with all the things we have ahead of us in terms of long term trends, in terms of good food and obviously also waste and all these things, I think it's going to only amplify in the future."},{"end_time":"2590170","segment_id":47,"speaker":"John Baumgartner","start_time":"2589530","text":"Thank you."},{"end_time":"2591770","segment_id":48,"speaker":"Stephan","start_time":"2590810","text":"You're welcome, John."},{"end_time":"2601980","segment_id":49,"speaker":"UNKNOWN","start_time":"2594170","text":"And the next question comes from John canwenning with DJS Securities. Please go ahead."},{"end_time":"2615100","segment_id":50,"speaker":"John canwenning","start_time":"2603260","text":"Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on a nice quarter. First, just a small one for Reuben Are there any repurchases assumed in the, in the EPS guidance for the year or the capital allocation?"},{"end_time":"2646550","segment_id":51,"speaker":"Ruben","start_time":"2618540","text":"No, we have not assumed that, only to the. What we have assumed is that our share count will stay flat. So there's always a bit of shares issued for share program we have internally and for that we assume some buyback. For the rest it is assumed flat. So you know, additional share buyback could be a tailwind. On the other hand, you also know that in EPS there might be a bit of headwind depending what the floating interest rate will do and all of that. So that's the assumption."},{"end_time":"2664030","segment_id":52,"speaker":"John canwenning","start_time":"2647270","text":"Got it. And then second, have you thought about the potential for tariffs from the US and how that might impact Europe, European markets and the ability to procure seafood that's denominated in US dollars And you know what the knock on impacts might be to you and how you might change your strategy to mitigate anything that might, that might flow through there to you?"},{"end_time":"2788910","segment_id":53,"speaker":"Ruben","start_time":"2664750","text":"Yeah. So just because I heard you saying denominated in US dollars also to be clear, you know, potential US dollar moves, our hedging strategy is such that we don't see a big impact into this year of the strengthening of the dollar. Strengthening of the dollar which we've seen over the last one or two months. So just to make that point clear, secondly and just to be clear, we don't export into the U.S. and if you look at our buy side outside fish, which I will come to, we don't import ingredients from the us so we don't see overall big impact on tariffs. Now if you do look at fish, maybe the US Russian fish, there's an executive order that Russian fish is not allowed into the us. We think if you look also a bit the population base from a US perspective, where a lot of that is in Alaska, we don't think that will change. But again no one knows in these times what we then see. There is a tariff in Europe, in the UK on fish, on that one for UK we're importing US fish. So not an impact for us. It could be that there's additional tariffs also in Europe, but at this moment we're not foreseeing that. Also because you have to look at the over fish supply where you know we would run out of fish if there would go up too much or sanction would go up too much. So actually we don't see that as a major risk. That doesn't mean we're complacent about it. So I think there's a more strategic work which we've done on looking at diversification of our fish sourcing that we are sure that in five to 10 years we have the right fish sourcing. So I think that's one element, the impact which. The element which could have an impact. But again, this is also a bit hypothetical or no one knows what will happen is an impact on the gas prices. But again, that's not the biggest spend of the item in our P and L where we freeze stuff instead of heating stuff. But that could have an impact. You've seen what will happen today with the gas prices. But again, a lot of sentences. The main point is we don't see a major impact of in terms of tariffs."},{"end_time":"2790670","segment_id":54,"speaker":"John canwenning","start_time":"2789790","text":"Great, thank you."},{"end_time":"2798750","segment_id":55,"speaker":"UNKNOWN","start_time":"2793470","text":"The next question comes from Peter Saleh with btig.

I just wanted to ask if you guys could provide a little bit more color on the overall consumer environment in Western Europe, just given the inflation that you're seeing, the incremental. Have you seen any change in behavior at all in some of your core markets, given that you're starting to see a little bit more inflation? Has that flowed through to the consumer already? Or are we still a little early on that front? Thank you."},{"end_time":"2894700","segment_id":57,"speaker":"Stephan","start_time":"2830210","text":"Well, I would put it that way. I think it's easy. Little by little it's improving, but it remains. It's not where it was before the crisis, but little by little. I think I would. But, Because when Ruben is talking about increased inflation, it's nothing comparable to what we had in 2022. So it's a bit of a price increase, but nothing major. So, yes, I think overall it remains, as I said, slightly improving, but takes a bit of time. What we see also see, which is good is private label is losing a bit of market share, which says something about obviously people coming back to brand and what they perceive, rightly so, by the way, in terms of quality. So that's good.

I'm happy to report that Nomad Foods had a strong finish to 2024 with impressive volume driven organic sales growth and robust margin expansion. Before I go too deep into results, I want to step back and reflect on where we are in our journey. As you can see on slide 3, we have now delivered nine consecutive years of sales and adjusted EBITDA growth. While this growth has been aided by M&A, organic growth has also been a strong and consistent contributor to this growth over time. In fact, in 2016 we have grown our organic sales at a nearly 3% target with growth in every year other than 2021 when we had the COVID demand spike. We are now entering our 10th year as a public company and are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth, including another year of organic growth in 2025. While generating considerable shareholder value, we have created an enviable company. Since embarking on this journey in 2015, we have assembled a portfolio of iconic brands with superior equity and strong market share positions and we have accomplished this while remaining focused building a pure play frozen food business that now spans both developed and developing markets across Europe. And we have acted with purpose, creating a portfolio of high quality, great tasting, convenient food that is good value and good for you. Roughly 2/3 of our portfolio is comprised of vegetables, fish and poultry and 93% of our European Western European revenue is generated from products deemed a healthy meal choice by the UK Government. And we've done this in a responsible way. I'm happy to share that Nomad Foods has been including the annual Dow Jones Sustainability Europe index for the fourth consecutive year while receiving a maximum score of 100 in health and nutrition for the sixth consecutive year. We are well positioned for the trends that are reshaping this industry. We have a clear portfolio advantage and we also have a people advantage. In recent years we have reshaped the organization. We have rewired how we work to improve efficiency, agility and ID sharing. We have upgraded our talent pool by promoting high performers from within while selectively hiring externally to fill knowledge and capability gaps where necessary. This has helped us own or strategy, energize organization and improve our execution. And lastly, we've been able to lean in and arm our team with the fuel they need to fund our strategy and initiatives. Our supply chain organization has delivered meaningful productivity over the past two years, while our strategic focus on driving growth in our profitable investment battles and growth platforms is delivering margin mix benefits that have allowed us to increase investment in our products or advertising in your in store merchandising while building capabilities in areas such as revenue growth management and cyber security among others. Given all of this, I feel great about how we positioned as we enter our 10th year as a public company and I'm confident we will deliver our 10th consecutive year of top and bottom line growth in 2025. Recent results only emboldened my confidence in this. It became clear to us in 2023 that the period of outsized inflation induced revenue growth was nearing an end. We knew that growth would become more dependent on volume gains, market share expansion and effective revenue growth management initiatives. It was then that we introduced our new commercial flywheel and innovation framework while beginning to increase our investment in our products, advertising and merchandising. Our amp spend increased by 14% in 2023 and then again by high single digits last year to 4% of net sales. This places us in the top tier for PE group and we expect A and P growth to once again outpace sales growth in 2025 and I'm excited to share some of our new creative with you later this year. It is some of the best I have ever seen from Nomad Foods. Our innovation meanwhile jumped from 4.2% in 2023 to 4.8% in 2024 and we expect it to easily exceed 5% in 2025. And when we combine innovation with renovation, we expect our renewal rate or percentage of sales where our products are new or refreshed to double from high single digits in 2024 to mid to high teens in 2025, we are upgrading our food and packaging to achieve superiority across an increasingly large percentage of our business. All of this is helping our commercial flywheel to spin faster and faster while delivering solid returns. As you can see on slide 5, we have now delivered three consecutive quarters of Boeing growth. Growth can move around quarter to quarter, so the trend line is clearly in the right direction. And while it helps that our European frozen food category is hefty and they are controlling much of our own destiny, although investments are supporting category growth while driving share growth, as you can see on slide 6, we have now achieved market share growth in each of the last two quarters and impressively, we accomplished this by expanding our gross margin. In fact, our gross margin in the last nine months of 2024 modestly exceeded the pre Covid level we achieved in 2019. Focus has been a key contributor to our success and focus will continue to define how we go to market in the future. We continue to concentrate a disproportionate amount of our time, energy and investment in our mushroom battles. These are the four category country combinations that are critically important to our success are margin accretive and where we have a clear right to win. The top 25 merchant backlogs accounted for more than half of our sales last year and an even larger share of our gross profit and grew net sales by 2.7% for the year and 3.5% in the quarter. While our focus remains on the upper midstream battles, recently we have been strategic investing behind select growth platforms. These are primarily areas where we see opportunities to leverage a capability in one market to extend our presence in another market. With a lift and launch approach. Our organic sales for growth platforms grew by 16% in 2024 and 40% in the fourth quarter. Over the past year we have been highlighting CaulFree. As one example, we have more than doubled our Call3 sales in the UK over the past five years and it has gone from a growth platform to a must win battle for us, even a success. Our goal is to make all of our growth platforms into machine battles over time. Italy and Germany are two more recent markets where we have made poultry into a growth platform seeking to replicate our success in the uk. The fraud and prepared poultry segment is underdeveloped in Italy and we began to invest in developing the segment there in early 2024. I'm happy to say that it is working. In the fourth quarter, our retail sales for prepared poultry in Italy rose 98% year on year with our market share growing from 8% in Q4 2023 to 50% in Q4 24. The category meanwhile is now growing 6% in Italy with Nomad accounting for more than 100% of the category growth. This is a great story for both us and our retail partners. In the back half of 2024 we turned our attention to Germany where the frozen prepared poultry market is large and well developed but dominated by private labor. Strategy is to create and premium teaser segment. I'm happy to say that we're finding success here too. It is early but in the fourth quarter our retail sales for prepared poultry rose 35% year on year. In Germany, we reached a 2.7% market share in the fourth quarter. That is 70 basis points higher than the prior year and illustrates how long the Runway could be for us in this market. The other growth platform we highlighted last year was potatoes. As a leading frozen fish company, it's only proper that we be a leading frozen chip company as well. In Belgium we already have a strong market share position on potatoes, but we are leaning in to make it even stronger and grow our market share by 420 basis points year on year four. And we're happy to report that we became the category lean and Belgium last year climbing from number two to number one in value share. In France, our share grew 550 basis points to 16.1% in the quarter. In the UK where the market is very large our share grew 70 basis points year on year to 8.9% a great accomplishment even if it's not keeping pace with the fantastic results in France and belgium. Turning to 2025, our playbook will not look meaningfully different. Our strategy is working and we will stay the course by championing frozen food. We will continue to focus on our investments now in our western battles and targeted growth platforms, but we will do it with more advertising, more innovation, more innovation and more revenue growth management initiatives. Ongoing productivity realization from across our organization is slowly investment growth allowing us to deliver balanced top and bottom line growth. And as has always been the case with no MyFood, we will deploy capital in ways that create value for shareholders and goes above and beyond organic growth. I'm excited to celebrate our 10th year as a public company with you in 2025. With that, let me turn it over to Ruben to tell you more about what we expect and provide some more detail on what we achieved last quarter. Ruben thank you Stefan and good morning everyone. I've been with the company now for roughly eight months and I'm increasingly confident in the opportunities that lie ahead of us. We have an amazing portfolio in a great category with top tier talent and nutritional tailwinds at our back. Our playbook is working and the innovation, renovation and marketing plans we have to drive sustainable growth in 25 and beyond are compelling. Turning to Results as you can see on slide 7 and 9 for the fourth quarter reported net revenues increased by 4.3% to 793 million Euro. Organic growth was 3.1% which marked our tenth consecutive quarter of organic growth. Volume growth remained positive for the third consecutive quarter rising by an impressive 4.7% while price mix was a negative 1.6% offset to volume growth as we reinvested some of our margin upside to drive impactful merchandising at retail. The net price investment was an 80 basis point headwind to gross margin and was more than overcome by 40 basis points of favorable mix and 160 basis points of productivity thanks to efficiency gains. This quarter, Robust gross margin and healthy revenue growth delivered a 9% increase in gross profit which was amplified by a 2.6% year on year decrease in SGA expenses to result in a 17.6 increase increase in adjusted EBITDA. The lower SGA expense was driven by lower amp expenses as we lapped the sharp increase in prior year investment and benefited from a more even investment cadence throughout the year. AMP investment rose high single digits for the year on top of double digit increase in 2023. Indirect investment growth slowed to low single digits in the quarter as we began to cycle the capability investment that began in late 23 and carried through to 24. Adjusted profit rose 28% year on year while adjusted EPS rose 31% to \u20ac42 cents as our diluted share count shrunk 3% year on year. For the full year we delivered our ninth consecutive year of sales and adjusted EBITDA growth as you can See on slide 8 and 10 Full year revenue grew 1.8% with organic sales rising 1% as volume returned to growth gaining 1.3% year on year. Gross margin rose from 40 basis points for the year to 29.6, nearly reaching the 30% pre Covid gross margin we achieved in 2019. Investment in price and promotion was a 70 basis point year on year headwind to our full year gross margin which was more than offset by 110 basis points of favorable margin mix and 100 basis points of net productivity realized by our supply chain teams. Our teams have a robust pipeline of productivity initiatives and I expect these benefits to continue funding our growth investments going forward. Our SGA expenses grew 7.4% for the full year as we increased our A and P and indirect investments each by high single digit. The higher A and P was a continuation of the reinvestment plans that we started in 2023 and continued in 24. We expect even more reinvestments in 25. The higher indirect expense was due to a combination of underlying inflation and capability investment scenarios such as cyber security and revenue growth management. With these investments now behind us, we expect much more moderate growth in indirect expenses going forward. Despite these investments made in 2024, we were still able to grow our adjusted EBITDA by 5.6% for the year. We're living near the high end of our initial 4 to 6% EBITDA growth guidance range that we gave this time last year. Our full year EPS of \u20ac1.78 was also near the high end of our initial \u20ac175 to \u20ac1.80 range. Turning to cash flow now strong fourth quarter results helped us over deliver on our full year cash flow guidance with free cash flow conversion of 101% coming in well above our initial 90 to 95 conversion guidance. We saw nice working capital inflows in the fourth quarter due to the normal seasonal timing of inventory balances and an unwind of the higher receivable balances that were happened in the third quarter due to timing dynamics. The strong free cash flow allowed us to return 208 million euros to shareholders in 24. First at 171 million euros will be returned to shareholders in 23, therefore more than a 20% increase last year. We returned the cash in the form of a $60 cent per share annual dividend and share repurchases. We finished the year with 156.1 million basis shares outstanding, a 4% reduction from where we finished 2023 over the past two years. We've now repurchased 290 million euro of our shares. Turning to our guidance for 25 on slide 12, we are pleased with the progress our commercial team has made improving the market results and restoring our market share to growth and we are happy to see our supply chain team delivering healthy productivity savings. This gives us strong momentum in Q25 which will be our 10th year as public company and is also expected to be our 10th year of positive revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth. We continue to expect organic sales growth of 1 to 3% for the year and adjusted EBITDA growth of 2 to 4%. We had a stronger than expected finish to 2024 which means we now expect a higher absolute level of adjusted EBITDA and as a result we have raised our full year adjusted eps range to \u20ac1.85 to \u20ac1.89 from the initial \u20ac1.81 to \u20ac1.85. At recent exchange rates, this translates into US dollar denominated EPS of $1.94 to $1.98. And lastly, we continue to expect full year adjusted free cash flow conversion of at least 90%. We expect to use this cash flow to create incremental value for shareholders that goes above and beyond organic growth. Our still relatively new dividend is a great example of this. As you may have seen our announcement last month, our Board of Directors has approved a 30% increase in the first quarter 25 as dividends to $7 cents per share from the $15 cents quarterly payout in 2024. As we think about the shape of the year, we expect growth to be somewhat choppy quarter to quarter, even the phasing of investments, prior year comparisons and some seasonal movement. Nonetheless, we expect the underlying trend line of improvement to hold throughout the year in totality. While our advertising investment growth will be meaningful late quarter one, our new innovation fuel distribution gains and associated merchandising activity is expected to be more phased into quarter 2 and quarter 3 this year. This, in combination with Easter falling into quarter 2 this year versus quarter 1 last year will lead to revenue headwinds in the first quarter. At this moment. We therefore expect organic sales to modestly decline in quarter one. These are just timing dynamics and not a reflection of the underlying health of the business. In fact, while shipments are moving around, we are happy to see our retail sales growing in 1% to 2% range over the past two months despite the later phasing of our activity. Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we are making. We returned the business to profitable volume and market share driven growth last year and are confident that we can keep the momentum going in 2025. And with that I will now turn the call back to the operator to open the line for questions. We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press STAR from one on your touchtone phone. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. If at any time your question has been addressed and you would like to withdraw your question, please press STAR and then two. Our first question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks so much and good morning. Good afternoon everybody. Good morning Andrew. Good morning Stephan. Maybe to start off what is your 1 to 3% organic sales growth forecast for full year 25 predicated on with respect to your expectations for category growth and market share performance? Well, as you may have seen, we, we are in the low inflation environment and we've come up with the 1% category growth as the first piece and the second piece is ourselves. Obviously overall, as we said, it's growing, but also very interestingly, our portfolio is really two. Third is poultry, fish, vegetables, which are growing very nicely. The commercial flywheel is working nicely. Innovation as we said, is around 5%. So the rest of the 1 to 3% is coming from this market share and mix and a bit of some net ERP. I would put it that way. Andrew. You remember that in Q3 we suffered of an ERP disruption in the UK, which is the biggest business for us. So obviously we keep going with ERP, which is the right thing to do. But this year, as we said, we decided to slow down the process, come up with a smaller part of the business and also all the lessons. So that's why I'm using the word net ERP. So will there be some disruption? Maybe much, much, much more limited than in Q, than Q3 last year. So that's where the 1 to 3% is coming from. Great. No, that's helpful. And then you mentioned in the fourth quarter you reinvested some of the upside in some of the sort of promotional activity, getting sort of distribution and some retail work and whatnot. And that obviously benefited volume pretty nicely as you move through the first quarter. I realize there's some impact on volume as you talked about, due to a later Easter and such. How would you expect sort of the price mix piece to come in now that you're two months through the first quarter? Would it be consistent on a year over year basis as an impact with what you saw in 4Q or more modest, do you think? Again, on the price mix side. Thanks so much. Yeah, let me answer that Andrew. And hopefully you appreciate that we cannot and will not give clear kind of guidance outlook between separate line items of the P&L and the price volume. But let me do try to give you some context. So you're absolutely right. If you look at the last three. Quarters, you've seen positive volume, especially in quarter four where we almost had 5% positive volume growth. And volume will remain important to us. It's important from a consumer perspective, retailer perspective, but also how it drives leverage in our factory. So we're not all overnight going to change that strategy where we drive efficiencies and reinvest that in volume. So that's one thing to the point of Stefan. So we've seen in the last two, three months lower inflation. And maybe that's also a separate question. If we look at kind of the full year and we're not fully hedged yet, but we might see a bit more inflation into this year, how that exactly plays out is still to be seen. But then we would need to take some pricing back. And again, if we see inflation and cost price, let's be absolutely clear, first of all, it's really to be cost competitive. So we continue all our efforts, we've done in terms of savings programs on procurement, continue to drive efficiencies in our factories, but also to drive efficiencies in indirect expenses. But there might be that a ladder is a remainder which we need to do with price. Now, how and when that price comes through is still to be seen. So, you know, at this moment, and you know, we've only had one month of actuals, we still see volume and a bit of pressure on price throughout the year. It could be that price comes back. So I think that is the context we can give you at this point. Thank you very much. The next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Great, thank you. Good morning. Good afternoon, everybody. Stephan, the stepped up innovation and renovation activity that you mentioned in your prepared remarks, I'm curious as to how much of that you expect to be focused on existing must win battles as opposed to some of the new and emerging growth platforms that you talked about in 25 and just how you think about striking that balance. Well, the thing is, to your point, it's going to be mostly growth, let's say must win battles and growth platforms. But let's say, let's put it that way, the must win battles are still very much the biggest piece of our business. So it's around 50% of our business and that's where the bulk of the innovation is going to go. This being said, at the same time, growth platform, which is let's say north of 100 million at this stage, is growing very nicely very fast. There's going to be a lot of list and launch, which is great. So it's going to be probably take proportionally a bigger part, but obviously applied on the smaller part of the business. But that's where the innovation is going to go first and foremost, must win battles, then obviously growth platforms. Okay, very good. And then you would also you talked about the organizational changes and the rewiring efforts that you've done to improve overall execution and agility, etc. To what extent do you feel that mission is sort of accomplished versus there being more work to do? And what would be the priorities in 25 on that front? Well, let me start with. Well, my statement. It is never finished. That's the first piece never finished because, well, you may know me as I'm never fully satisfied anyway. So you never hear me something like fantastic and all these things because these words do not exist in my. Pardon me, ladies and gentlemen, Please stand by while we reconnect the speaker line. Hi, this is the operator. We have now brought in the speaker line. Sam can proceed. Thank you very much. So Steve, sorry for the interruption. So I could feel, I could feel your passion. Your passion was so great. You. I'm not pleased with what happened right now, I can tell you. But fine. So my point is, no, it's never finished. But this being said, we have, I mean we have really simplified the organization big time last year. So you remember that we had, you know, at some stage, 22 countries and they're reporting a bit, you know, it was a bit, I wouldn't say it was optimal. Now we have all these guys reporting to one person, six clusters and I think it's a big, big change. In the meantime, we have obviously invested heavily in things like growth, like revenue growth management, innovation as well in service of obviously these clusters. Supply chain is really, it's a never ending process anyway, restructuring improvements, making sure that these savings are going to come back and then be in a position to invest behind the beyond A and P and gross margin ultimately. So my point is it's never finished. But let's say what we have accomplished last year was really meaningful. Now obviously we also have to remain very, very cost conscious because basically what I want to do to achieve is to put most of our, let's say savings behind A and P and innovation and then obviously in service of short term and long term ebitda. But that's how we want to be so lean in terms of indirect after having restructured and clarified the whole structure and then making sure that obviously our top line will be served the right way. Very good. I appreciate all that. I'll pass it on. Thank you. Thank you. And the next question comes from Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Great, thanks so much. I guess maybe just first question on around gross margin. You know, I think about a year or so ago you kind of the, the idea was you can gradually get back right to the 30% gross margin range or somewhere around there, you know, really based on volume recovery also combined with just all the pro, the productivity initiatives and the, and the mix benefits, you know, as we think through kind of 25 relative 24. Your first question is like, seems like you're kind of already there, right? Like as you finish the full year 24, you're pretty close already. You know, is there, is there any kind of change to thinking in terms of like what the real gross margin benefit, you know, from here could be on the business just given really the focus on must win battles, given the volumes starting to recover, given the productivity initiatives? That's just the first question. Thank you. Yeah, let me answer that. Thanks for the question again. You know, our strategy will continue the same way and no change that we will continue. That's our commitment to drive efficiencies in supply chain. You've seen that in quarter four. In both the full year we had full year round, 100, 110 basis points of supply chain efficiencies. Quarter four we had supply chain efficiencies. We will continue to drive that. Right? And what we then said, we will reinvest those efficiencies together with our continued effort of driving mix into our brands and products. Now most of that will be an investment in amp and into the product, but it could also be that we do some investment in prices you have seen over the last three quarters. So that is our commitment. We're not, you know, at this moment going to say this is our guidance for gross margin in 25, whether that will be 30. We're very happy that you see the recovery in 24. We will continue to drive the drivers, but as I said also there will be a bit of inflation. Again, we need to be cost competitive. We have to take some prices and that will lead and we'll see how we then end with the gross margin. On the long term. I think we will continue to drive a further gross margin recovery. How it plays out in 25 is still to be seen. Okay, great, perfect. And then maybe just a bigger question for you, Stephan, just around kind of strategic opportunities, inorganic strategic opportunities and kind of where you sit now, you know, kind of, you know, for a long time Nomad was clearly, you know, acquiring a lot more actively. Lots occurred, you know, over the past three, four years that made that maybe a little bit more complicated, maybe valuations even a little lower. I'm just curious, kind of where you sit today. Are you more actively thinking about acquisition potential? If there were something that were to come up that were attractive, would you still consider that? Or are you maybe in a period right now such that the focus on the core portfolio really is primary number one initiative? And you really kind of think at some point we'll get back there. But right now we're really not thinking about acquisition potential at this point. That's all. Thanks so much. Thanks, Rob. Well, the point is, with or without acquisitions, Rob, the focus has always been, you know, the existing portfolio. That's the first piece we never deviated. You know, even when we did, you know, the Switzerland or Goodfellas or Aunt Bessie's or the Adriatics, we never deviated. That's the key piece. And that's the key piece because I don't think you can be a good acquirer if you're not doing the right job with your core business. Because the business model behind the acquisitions are always predicated on a very solid model, organic model. And that's why we never did any acquisitions between 15, 16, 17, because we had nothing to offer. We had first to clean up the whole thing, and then we started. So now, Obviously, since basically 2022, we stopped to your point because basically, first we need to focus on the business as such even more. That's one thing. And second, because there was a big difference between sellers and buyers, I think this is reducing the gap, is reducing a bit. In the meantime, no regret, we keep buying back shares, which is the best acquisitions we can do. But also at the same time, I think what we also see is there are some maybe under the radar screen things, not shiny objects that we could consider in our category, you know, new subcategories in some countries where we have a lot of synergies, and that's the kind of things more and more we are considering. Nothing done yet, but obviously I'm not in the business of disclosing any names that would be the smart thing to do. No guarantee to do anything, Rob, because if you guarantee something, that's the best way to make mistakes, by the way. But definitely we believe that we have something to offer which is not necessarily the big names in Europe, but others add ons deals. And I think by doing so we could create a nice pipeline of M and A. We're also creating a pipeline of innovation. And maybe just to build on that. And I can give credits to Stefan, I wasn't there. But since 2016, end of 2016, this business has deployed roughly 1.2 billion for M&A while shrinking the share count by 13%. 13%. And this combined with our organic growth, has allowed us to increase our ebitda per share by 97, almost 100%, nearly doubling it from 2016 to 2024. And we were doing this whilst you've seen the dividends and lowering our net debt to EBITDA leverage. So I think that also tells you something, in my humble opinion. Yeah, of course. Thank you so much. Very impressive. Thank you, Rob. And the next question comes from John Baumgartner with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Hi, John. Hey, Stephan. Good morning. Good afternoon. Maybe first question, I wanted to come back to the Enterprise Wide transformation. The charges taken for that program in the quarter were fairly sizable. How far along are you in terms of taking these charges at this point, implementing the program? And then on the other side of that, how should we think about the ramp and the related efficiency benefits? I know it's not something you normally discuss in detail, but should that ramp in efficiencies begin in 2025, is it more 2026? Just any thoughts there? Yeah, now let me answer that. It's a good question, John. So a couple points. You've seen that on the line. Yeah, maybe you can go, Jonathan. So the rent in terms of cost was around 5 million over the quarter. As well as if you look at. The last year, what we said before some interaction is we will bring that down, but clearly we're not all of a sudden going to halt that. But can we bring that down? These run rates with 20, 25%, that is clearly the aim and we should, we are working towards. That's one point. I think the other point is what Stefan said is to come to your question on efficiencies. The other point is what Stefan just said in terms of not having disruptions again, we will go slower, smaller and simpler and slower means one of the lessons is, you know, you need proper time to test it to onboard our teams and our people and our suppliers. That's one point. We will go smaller. So what we're going to put life at the end of this year, the current plan is that what we went live last year was around a third of our business. What we're going to put live this year is not even 15% of our business. So we will go smaller. And the third bit is where we're going to simplify. So that's the second point I want to bring in. The third point is the efficiency ramp up. There are elements related to the fact that you need a whole new enterprise system and that will help us. But the big efficiency gains in terms of What Stefan spoke about simplifying the organization in terms of factory optimization, both at a factory as well as on a macro level in terms of supplier rationalization. Nothing is stopping us to do that already. In the next quarter, in the next one or two years. Okay, okay, great. Thanks for that. And then a follow up on the commentary on pricing. I'm curious as you sort of see the waves of material inflation having passed and you look back and assess how the volumes are evolving after the rebasing these higher price levels for the category, how do you think about everyday value for your frozen categories at this point? And do you sense that anything has changed in terms of maybe frost elasticities relative to fresh or shelf stable options for consumers in the categories? Well, I think vis a vis, let's say the center store and obviously fresh, it's a bit more difficult to see. The only thing we see we've seen is during this crisis, as expected as category leader, we led the price increases and the other guys have been a bit slower to react, including the private label. So it's been a great time for private label in terms of market share, as expected by the way. But we have no regret because that was the right thing to do. I by far prefer back to, to Rob's question. Where do we stand with gross margin? I can tell you we wouldn't have this. We would not talk about whether you're going to go back to 30% that we would have been very far from that. Now what we see is at least in the category. John, I would put in the category. I think what we see is we are obviously we're regaining market share. It's a bit choppy still, but we're getting market share versus private level, which is good because the market, let's say the price has stabilized, which is the good news as well. Now back to your question and correct me if I'm wrong. How are we doing versus other categories like fresh or center store? Well, I think overall, I think it's more than ever frozen has proven to be a very resilient and good category. And I would say with all the things we have ahead of us in terms of long term trends, in terms of good food and obviously also waste and all these things, I think it's going to only amplify in the future. Thank you. You're welcome, John. And the next question comes from John canwenning with DJS Securities. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on a nice quarter. First, just a small one for Reuben Are there any repurchases assumed in the, in the EPS guidance for the year or the capital allocation? No, we have not assumed that, only to the. What we have assumed is that our share count will stay flat. So there's always a bit of shares issued for share program we have internally and for that we assume some buyback. For the rest it is assumed flat. So you know, additional share buyback could be a tailwind. On the other hand, you also know that in EPS there might be a bit of headwind depending what the floating interest rate will do and all of that. So that's the assumption. Got it. And then second, have you thought about the potential for tariffs from the US and how that might impact Europe, European markets and the ability to procure seafood that's denominated in US dollars And you know what the knock on impacts might be to you and how you might change your strategy to mitigate anything that might, that might flow through there to you? Yeah. So just because I heard you saying denominated in US dollars also to be clear, you know, potential US dollar moves, our hedging strategy is such that we don't see a big impact into this year of the strengthening of the dollar. Strengthening of the dollar which we've seen over the last one or two months. So just to make that point clear, secondly and just to be clear, we don't export into the U.S. and if you look at our buy side outside fish, which I will come to, we don't import ingredients from the us so we don't see overall big impact on tariffs. Now if you do look at fish, maybe the US Russian fish, there's an executive order that Russian fish is not allowed into the us. We think if you look also a bit the population base from a US perspective, where a lot of that is in Alaska, we don't think that will change. But again no one knows in these times what we then see. There is a tariff in Europe, in the UK on fish, on that one for UK we're importing US fish. So not an impact for us. It could be that there's additional tariffs also in Europe, but at this moment we're not foreseeing that. Also because you have to look at the over fish supply where you know we would run out of fish if there would go up too much or sanction would go up too much. So actually we don't see that as a major risk. That doesn't mean we're complacent about it. So I think there's a more strategic work which we've done on looking at diversification of our fish sourcing that we are sure that in five to 10 years we have the right fish sourcing. So I think that's one element, the impact which. The element which could have an impact. But again, this is also a bit hypothetical or no one knows what will happen is an impact on the gas prices. But again, that's not the biggest spend of the item in our P and L where we freeze stuff instead of heating stuff. But that could have an impact. You've seen what will happen today with the gas prices. But again, a lot of sentences. The main point is we don't see a major impact of in terms of tariffs. Great, thank you. The next question comes from Peter Saleh with btig. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter. I just wanted to ask if you guys could provide a little bit more color on the overall consumer environment in Western Europe, just given the inflation that you're seeing, the incremental. Have you seen any change in behavior at all in some of your core markets, given that you're starting to see a little bit more inflation? Has that flowed through to the consumer already? Or are we still a little early on that front? Thank you. Well, I would put it that way. I think it's easy. Little by little it's improving, but it remains. It's not where it was before the crisis, but little by little. I think I would. But, Because when Ruben is talking about increased inflation, it's nothing comparable to what we had in 2022. So it's a bit of a price increase, but nothing major. So, yes, I think overall it remains, as I said, slightly improving, but takes a bit of time. What we see also see, which is good is private label is losing a bit of market share, which says something about obviously people coming back to brand and what they perceive, rightly so, by the way, in terms of quality. So that's good. But yeah, I think that's where we see it and which is fully reflected in our guidance, by the way. Thank you very much. You're welcome. This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Stefan Deshmaker for any closing remarks. Thank you very much. So I'm proud of the progress our company has made over the past year and confident in our growth outlook going forward. Our strategy is working and our teams are executing our plans well. We have compelling innovation, renovation, advertising and merchandising plans slated for 2025, which when combined with our ongoing productivity through programs give us good visibility to another year of top and bottom line growth. We expect to keep our top and bottom line growth streak going again in 2025, extending the streak to 10 years as we mark our 10 year anniversary as a public company. Thank you to all our employees and investors who have joined us on this journey. The best is yet to come. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.","transcript_id":"a4c022e6-8699-4b4b-ab1f-6d50a88c2b6d","type":"NON_LIVE"}],"updated_at":"2025-03-03T15:31:07Z"},{"audio":{"content_type":"audio/mpeg","quality":"192kbps","url":"https://cdn.kscope.io/ks-trsc-6b0610f53c192b0fd647fcd.mp3?key=0168e3f5-cb74-4278-8437-b3db550908bb"},"call_id":"6b0610f53c192b0fd647fcd","call_title":"Eni

Our February Capital Market update emphasized the speed and scale at which we had been progressing our strategy Quarter one maintained the pace and recent events have confirmed why our clarity of strategic view a speed of action is so critical. We are creating value, leveraging our competitive strength in the upstream, strengthEning and diversifying the company, fixing and then performing activities, materially strengthEning our balance sheet, all while offering a competitive and resilient return to investors. Reviewing the important strategic highlights of the quarter and year to date, growth is an important feature in our plan in the upstream In March Johan Castberg began production and will add 66,000 barrels per day of oil production at Plateau for VAR as it targets over 400,000 barrels per day by the fourth quarter. Castberg is the first of the five major startups due this year with Valderiks in Norway, Agogo and NGC in Angola plus Congo and Gina Krog phase 2 to follow, setting us up for a strong 2026 in the transition business. PlEnitude, has completed the construction of its 200 megawatt battery in Texas and acquired 245 MW in its share of photovoltaic and storage in California while Eni Live began production of SAF at its new 400,000 tonne per year facility at Gela in Sicily. We are also realizing significant value through the investment of aligned capital and into our transition businesses and the valorization of our industry leading exploration activity via the dual model. We had closely agreed increase in AP's stake in plEnitude to 10% with an additional cash of 209 million Euro at the end of March. We also closed the increase in KKR stake in Nili to 30% with an additional cash in of 601 million Euro in April. This followed the 2.97 billion we collected at the beginning of March. Furthermore, we have received non binding offer for additional stakes in PlEnitude, that could take aligned investment to 25 30%. We consider around 70% a majority any stake in both our major transition business as broadly the right level for the time being in the upstream. Also in March we announced a major dual exploration valorization of with the agreement to sell stakes in Baleen in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Congo LNG in the Republic of Congo to Vitol, for a cash in of around $2.7 billion expected to complete later this year. Our satellite model is an important feature of our business and in the upstream In February we announced an MOU with partners to combine assets with a mixed component of growth and value in Indonesia and Malaysia. This is really a significant development for Eni, creating a new and highly material regional satellite in an important part of the world with a strong partner and with the added opportunity of some cash valorization alongside. We expect to move to a definitive agreement around the middle of this year with the completion before the end of 2025. Structural response in some of our legacy activities are also required as the energy evolves. The transformation of Versalis over the next four five years is a major positive source of self help amounting to more than 1 billion euro per year EBITDA improvement by 2030. We have positive news to report here as well with the agreement reached with the institution and the unions on the details of our plan. We closed Brindisi, the first of the remaining two steamcrackers at the end of March and Priolo will be shut down before the end of this year. Our strategy is designed to create a stronger, more profitable and more Resilient company. Our first quarter results demonstrate this net income 1.4 billion euro is up around 60% quarter on quarter in a very similar scenario setting upstream production was in line with our expectation as 2024 divestment impacts work through seasonal factors play out and we weigh the positive impact of the startups that will contribute to our full year expectation of around 1.7 million barrels per day average. At the segment level, EMP performed an EBITDA of 3.3 billion euro, almost offsetting lower crude and production year on year helped by lower expenses and efficiency gains and the benefit of portfolio grading. GGP's results reflect the normal seasonal strength and were essentially in line with last year. An Eni Live and Plenitude reported pro-forma results consistent with our full year expectations. Once respective seasonalities take into account, Eni Live was impacted by the deterioration in the biofuel margins year on year and also lower bio refinery utilization, albeit by refining. EBITDADA remained positive. This was partially offset by positive evolution of our marketing operation, planning to record a 3% EBITDADA improvement year over year supported by strong retail results and rising renewable generation. In our transformation activity, both refining and chemical were loss making. Refining results reflect the weaker margin year on year and lower throughputs over the closure of Livorno plus the extended turnaround of Sanazaro in the quarter. Our continued losses in Chemical reflect the challenging scenario in Europe that we consider to be a structural feature and confirm our action to restructure and transform this business. Cash flow before working capital of Euro 3.4 billion in the quarter were consistent with our full year guidance of 13 billion euro a $75 per barrel. The cash tax rate was around 30% in line with normal levels and dividends received were in line with associated net income. CapEx in the quarter was 1.9 billion Euro, a little below the run rate of 9 billion Euro in the February guidance. Valuation and divestment proceed net of acquisitions in the quarter total 3 billion euro and including cash in for our transition satellites we repurchased 386 million euro shares in this quarter completing our 2 billion euro 2024 program. We expect to begin the 2025 1.5 billion euro buyback program after the shareholder approval in May. Balance sheet leverage was 18%, 4% lower than the four year last quarter despite a weaker dollar adding 1 percentage point, while our pro forma leverage incorporating agreed transactions still to close stood at 12%, an improvement of 3% percentage point from end 2024 and the minimum in our history. Volatility and cyclicity is a recurring feature of this industry. Every two, three years we are impacted by an external event, so it is a really normal course of business. Our company needs to be prepared, as it should be, to leverage the cyclical upswing. Given the current scenario, it is worth reviewing our balance sheet in a little more detail. In the past five quarters we have announced over 9 billion euro in tail asset divestment, dual exploration, valorization and aligned external investment into our transition oriented business. We have executed faster and for greater value than we and certainly the market expected. Moving quickly to lower our leverage, an additional element of protection is provided by our satellites. The model not only enables us to raise capital and self finance our growth while highlighting the valuation multiples related to transition business or specific upstream geography such as Norway, but it also strengthens our resilience during downturn phases. On one end we are able to contain our leverage through targeted business valorisation. On the other, the availability of autonomous entities capable of containing price downturns with their own balance sheets allows us to secure more stable cash flow via dividends and hence we are less affected by market volatility. Our consolidated balance sheet is just about the strongest in our history. At the end of the quarter we had over 28 billion euro financial asset and now draw committed lines and we have lengthened maturities by more than two years. Over the past two years we estimate that our net cost of net debt in 2025 will be below 1.5%. This position will enable us to continue to balance pursuing our strategy, remaining resilient and flexible and deliver our returns to shareholders. When we discussed our plan and four year strategy, we emphasized the value in the consistency of in our approach. We have also confirmed our dividend at 1.05 Euro and the share buyback totaling 1.5 billion Euro itself a minimum floor that we are committed to maintaining even under adverse market scenarios and we need to be nimble and responsive to the changing condition. The work we have done on the balance sheets are passed significantly, but there are also further measures we will now begin to take to reinforce our financial position without compromising our medium long term objective of our investment proposition. We have identified over 2 billion Euro of initial actions to enhance our free cash flow positions and lowering our cash neutrality by around $15 per bar including additional portfolio upside, selected capex rescheduling over the coming months, active working capital management aimed at enhancing cash recovery and structural cost optimization initiative. Together these actions further enhance our financial position and the risk shareholder distribution. In summary, the additional financial trends we have introduced into ENI over the past year, the intrinsic resilience of the model we have built and the additional options and levers we are available mean we can maintain underlying strategy and also confirm the full distribution policy we have announced. With the current scenario headwinds, we are focused on delivering our underlying performance and leveraging our portfolio optionality to offset cash flow impacts and deliver our distribution commitments. We therefore can confirm our full year production outlook of 1.7 million barrels per day. We also confirm our profitability guidelines for GGP in alive and plEnitude. At our lowered scenario assumption we expect to generate 11 billion euros of cash flow from operation a little better underlying than our sensitivities imply. We expect to offset this impact with the cash mitigation measure I described including net CAPEX to below 6 billion Euro. Therefore, we can also confirm leverage between 0.15 0.2 in 2025 within the 0.1 and 0.2 plan range. We are very satisfied with our progress in 2025 year to date both on the strategic and financial sides. The macro scenario has deteriorated, is volatile and Uncertain. But the action we are taking and flexibility we have mean we are in a position to resist its full impact. We can therefore advance our strategy and deliver on our shareholder commitments. With that I conclude my remarks and welcome any questions you may have."},{"end_time":"798830","segment_id":2,"speaker":"John","start_time":"772370","text":"Thank you, Francesco.

So far neither the operator of the asset nor the shareholder and the contracting company have been engaged by the authority for any production cuts."},{"end_time":"1025980","segment_id":13,"speaker":"Stefano Ballista","start_time":"890690","text":"Yes, thank you for the question Talking about biofuel view well, first of all this is a year of oversupply. This is something well known Rough Number is about 2 million oversupply is supply versus demand in the first quarter we saw demand, expected growth in demand and we will deep dive a little bit has not come yet and reason is that actually players have the whole year to satisfy obligations and second reason actually there are some uncertainties in the US that we expect to be clearly defined moving forward on demand is worth to highlight the sustainable aviation fuel 2% target for the EU pretty much in this first half didn't come through. It is expected for the second half, and the reasons pretty much are twofold the chance to get to satisfy the yearly demand and second logistic facility to be in place about us it's important to highlight that low carbon fuel Standard target of an increase GHG reduction to 30% at the beginning of the year expected 1st of April has been delayed given to technical, let me say request from the Office of Administrative Law of California. And now it is expected well, until some weeks ago was beginning of September. Now it's expected beginning of July as CARB has already given a review of these technical aspects. So overall we see a path of margin increasing thanks to this rebalancing pathway we are viewing. I have to say clearly it's very relevant that we focus on value, not on volume. This is a clear strategic approach on an oversupplied market. This is what we are doing. We are definitely focused on value, even reducing in some case volume. The more the system will move in this direction, the better is going to be the improvement trajectory we are seeing and foreseeing."},{"end_time":"1029180","segment_id":14,"speaker":"Alejandro Vigil","start_time":"1028620","text":"Thank you."},{"end_time":"1036380","segment_id":15,"speaker":"John","start_time":"1029980","text":"Thanks Alejandro. The next question is from Biraj Bakhtarya at RBC. Biraj,."},{"end_time":"1097180","segment_id":16,"speaker":"Biraj Bakhtarya","start_time":"1038290","text":"Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Francesco. You touched on obviously the strength of the balance sheet and the progress you've made there, which is obviously now looking in good shape. I was wondering, we have obviously seen the environment deteriorate a little bit more. You've touched on some of the smaller changes you've made to your capital program. But I guess the question is what will you need to see price wise or signal wise to adjust your, you know, activities more materially there. And then just to follow up for Stefano on sustainable aviation in in late March, there was a joint statement from your customers, the airlines arguing about concerns on availability and then the cost of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) suggesting these mandates were not realistic or achievable. So I just wanted your thoughts on whether it's is it reasonable or realistic to assume that these mandates could be relaxed this year or do you expect policymakers to hold firm that. Thank you."},{"end_time":"1219370","segment_id":17,"speaker":"Francesco Gattei","start_time":"1098620","text":"Yes. About the CapEx and the reaction to the price signals. Clearly we think that at the end of the day, once there is a deterioration the scenario, you have the opportunity substantially to use different levers that you let's say prioritize in terms of effectiveness in terms also on impacts in in future in future trends of the of the company and the target that the company has set. For this reason we have, you've seen that we have announced that this 2 billion of improvement in in cash that is for around an alpha or around and half is related to capex and cost improvement. So shifting certain investment, postponing or extending the execution of certain activity efficiency. There is also a natural trend related to a lower market scenario that will imply a lower cost in executing the activity and the remaining part is related split half and half between a portfolio improvement and the working capital effectiveness or a new action in term of valorisation on working capital or stocks and managing this this activity this give us more flexibility for a worse scenario in case it be necessary I would say that there is no special or strict rules what is the price that will imply a change in our CapEx profile? Clearly if there is a further deterioration of this scenario we will continue to apply even more lever including the one that you are referring capex but also other activities that we can expedite and will contribute to cash even in a lower scenario. So I don't have a specific answer what I can say there is flexibility in our plan even to adjust to lower prices Then I leave to Stefano."},{"end_time":"1341640","segment_id":18,"speaker":"Stefano Ballista","start_time":"1219770","text":"Yes, thank you Francesco and thanks for the question. Actually short answer is no, we definitely don't think there is any chance to not have in place this target, this is a mandatory target, 2% within the end of the year and if you don't fulfill it, there will be a carryover of the target next year and and a penalty as well. Let me add just a couple of comments on the topic as a whole actually SAF capacity it's in place in Europe and not only Europe actually we have also some capacity capacity in the US and in China as well in Europe just to make an example we got Gela with up to 400k tonnes per year and we just start up production beginning of this year. So the current mandate of 2% that equal about a million, a million point two as capacity to be definitely fulfilled. So this is the first comment. Second comment, the target is on fuel suppliers, not on airlines, and even the matter of logistics actually it's not there because for a transition period you can fulfill the mandate in a single airport. You don't need to be physically blending biojet in each airport. This gives a lot of, let's say, flexibility in having it done. And then let me say as last comment, probably in terms of target I would have a slightly different perspective now we got 2% in place up to 2030 and then 66%. So it's three times just from one year to the next in order to have, let's say a proper development of the investments actually would be a proper approach to get a sort of step up along the way and in that way you can let's say have a balanced approach between supply and demand. So there is, I mean space to work together with airlines to couple with the energy transition and the GHG reduction targets in an effective and efficient way."},{"end_time":"1344680","segment_id":19,"speaker":"Biraj Bakhtarya","start_time":"1343800","text":"Thank you very much."},{"end_time":"1351560","segment_id":20,"speaker":"John","start_time":"1345480","text":"Thanks Bharaj.

Two questions please. One, I wanted to come back talk about asset sales. Could you talk about how confident you are in closing your sale to Vitol and maybe just characterize the market to selling assets. You talked about some non-binding offers for Plenitude. Are there still live discussions happening there and how are you thinking about that? Is it better to sell now or, or maybe even weights for higher values? Maybe just talk about Plenitude and what you're thinking on that. And then the second question on Namibia. There was some news last week that you hit hydrocarbons at your latest well. Well I think that's now two from two. So maybe you can just talk about the next steps and what you can share so far what you've learned from your campaign there. Thank you."},{"end_time":"1480870","segment_id":22,"speaker":"Francesco Gattei","start_time":"1404220","text":"Thank you. The first very fast clearly asset sales we are extremely confident first of all because we already cashed in an additional 600 in early April and 11th of April. That is the amount that is related to the top up of the 5% on the any live KKR deal. Then we are working on this plenitude potential transaction 15, 20% the the non binding offer are there. There is I would say a strong competition pressure. I don't see any, let's say, loss of valuation under the current market. Also because this is clearly a deal that has a long term perspective and also eventually will be helped by a reduction or expectation or lower interest rate in the future on the deal on Africa, West Africa with all we have all the documents ready and signed and we are just waiting for the various approval that are requiring this activity. There is no mock provision that will impede to proceed. So I would say that almost 90 95% of our plan is already in our end or with a very positive perception of its execution in term of Namibia.

The well successfully penetrated the target and the reservoir is showing good petrophysical properties. No water oil, no water contact. We made an intensive acquisition campaign, wild line loggings, hydrocarbon samples, sidewall cores and in addition to that we made also a well test and we achieved a flow rate in excess of 11,000 barrel of oil per day which Was surface constrained. The oil is light with limited associated gas and very low inert gas. So very positive, very interesting. More assessment and more analysis, of course, will have to be made. So the well will be temporarily plugged and abandoned and the rig will be released. And then we assess the full size.

I will reply to the first question: then I leave back to Guido for the Argentinian questions about the buyback. Clearly you know that once we set our distribution policy and the amount starting level for the buyback, we set that in a way that will be a flaw and therefore we are going to execute this. Clearly we give the reference in terms of percentage of cash flow distribution, but we have all the levers to keep this, this distribution policy and buyback affordable in our balance sheet because there is a lot of other tools that are not just the percentage of cash flow from operations, but also the capability as we are seeing in this maneuver, to balance this distribution also with free cash flow improvement in terms of portfolio or in term of working capital. And clearly the leverage level is another factor that have to be considered once you have to manage the fluctuation of prices. So I think there is no issue at all on confirming this 1.5 billion even in a lower scenario. Clearly eventually you could accelerate or slow down a bit the pace of of buyback, but this is part of the normal activity that we are able to execute within the almost one year of, of of the.

This has the objective to hit more than 30 million tonnes per annum by the early 2030. It has different phases, three phases which will be run in parallel. Eni and YPF signed an MoU to execute one of these three phases which would reach a total of 12 million tonnes per annum. We're joining YPF who has a very strong and deep country knowledge on the unconventional upstream of Vaca Muerta. They are operating the South Set for decades, so they know pretty well the subsurface, and all development and operation activities. While on our side zni, we are recognized as a fast track and low cost project operator, and we would bring our experience and leadership, particularly on floating LNG projects. We are looking at this Argentina LNG project and full value chain to complement our portfolio of LNG and also to reach our strategic target, of 20 million tons per annum. And we think that the the combination of the expertise of YPF on the upstream of Vaca Muerta and the expertise of ENI on the midstream floating LNG will set this venture for success."},{"end_time":"1865640","segment_id":34,"speaker":"John","start_time":"1859320","text":"Thanks, Guido.

The first, I wanted to come back to the capex cuts that you sort of laid out today. You've sort of listed optimization and postponement of projects as one of the sources of the reduction in capex. I just wanted to understand which projects you're specifically referring to. And I guess my broader question was if the current commodity price scenario was to extend into next year, would any of these projects not just be postponed but be canceled? So that would be the first question and then the second one, I wanted to come back to Namibia if I could, noting the information that you put out on the latest well today. I mean, given you have had additional time in the lab with the first discovery, I just wondered if you could compare or contrast them. Is it the correct read that the second discovery has better characteristics than the first? Or what additional insights could you give us there, please?

And then secondly on the Indonesia Malaysia combination, I see you continue to progress the negotiations there.

Once you set up the new entity, the new company, you clearly design not only the business plan with the investments and the different or relative ratio between the parties, but it also a financial plan that is a result of the addition of this kind of asset and, therefore, the capability for the new entity to leverage on this asset for more financial capability, and therefore there is generally a contribution that is related to the possibility to have certain dividend up front that will help to generate cash, more cash than in a standalone situation. And then on Cyprus, if we may."},{"end_time":"2220180","segment_id":41,"speaker":"Guido Brusco","start_time":"2117390","text":"Cyprus we are working for an FID within the year with the partners and the two host governments, it will be a subsea tie-back to the Egyptian facilities.

So if we will be able to make an FID by the end of this year, production may come sometime between Q4, 27, Q1, Q1 2028. Of course to have Egypt again as a net exporter. A few more things need to happen. There is a growing confidence on the ability of Egypt to kick out more Investment they continue to pay their outstanding receivables. So there is more activity in general not just from ENI but also from other operator. And there is also again a restart of the journey on the increase of the capacity of renewables, which will free up more gas for exports.

I was wondering if you can give us maybe more colors on those as well. And with regard to Argentina, I was wondering what is the level of investment that you're planning to make over the next few years and whether potentially you're looking to invest in upstream?

CapEx as we said are mainly related to postponed a certain activity that could be extended without major impacts on big project, but just related to certain activity that could be say executed in a longer time in terms of cost. There will be a natural reduction in term of cost also related to a lower scenario. And we do expect that there is also benefit from the portfolio activity of the remaining 1 billion that we said there is almost half so around the 500 million is related to the portfolio improvement in terms of less cash out and better value on the potential cash inflow.

The first question was just on the tax rate in the quarter a bit lower than we expected. Can you perhaps just outline what was driving that and then maybe what we should expect for the rest of the year. Will it kind of return to that 50 to 55% range? And then the second question was just on production in the quarter, particularly gas. There's quite a large sequential step down. I think you call out disposals in the release, but I thought those were more oil weighted. So I just wanted to check was anything like maintenance or turnarounds kind of impacting that gas number in the quarter. Thanks."},{"end_time":"2530830","segment_id":55,"speaker":"Francesco Gattei","start_time":"2456260","text":"Yeah. About the tax rate, clearly the tax rate in this quarter was positively impacted by the structure of the results. Is a quarter where you have the benefit of contribution from GGP, from Plenitude for the power and this is lowering for generally, let's say higher prices of both oil and gas. So from the geographies of even in upstream that have a lower tax rate. So this quarter is a quarter that of a tax rate that you could generally expect once there is this mix of contributors, the trend for the year in a scenario that we lowered in terms of mainly of oil prices will see this tax rate increasing towards the upper end of the expectation. 55% could be a rough estimate where you could see the results coming. So clearly the quarter will contribute, but we do expect an increase in the coming months because the price of oil that we are designing or are planning is lower and the contribution of the lower tax rate businesses will be less impactful.

First, a quick question on cash flow from your recently announced recent disposals. How much would you expect to close and book in the second quarter, please? And then secondly on emp, your underlying per barrel EBIT margin has improved sequentially quite a lot given it was in a similar oil price environment. You have indicated that around half of your planned disposals in the four year plan is from upstream. So, my question is, can we anticipate that as you continue high grading the portfolio that unit margin improvement can continue further and of course it is structural. So presumably also your oil price sensitivity may change over time.

These are clearly structural because except for the few delays that we mentioned that are spread around between executing certain activities, the rebranding of Eni Live stations or EV charge or certain activity, all the rest are related to factoring in working capital management. That means substantially is something that is not absorbed during the year and the cost reduction that as we said also is related to the improvement and also the scenario that we are facing that clearly has a lower cost of energy overall.

First I just wanted to come back to the capital allocation changes that Eni made this morning and particularly gross capex. It looks like you sort of effectively put through the lower part of a 5 to 10% reduction in full year gross CAPEX versus what you outlined in Feb. If you aggregate everything up, can you just share a sense of how much of that is activity related versus sort of finding underlying efficiency measures. And then secondly, following up on the comments earlier on refining, if you take refining and Versalis combined, clearly still a challenge in Q1. Are there any signs of more recently of any improvement in margins to the degree that you're seeing some degree of lower feedstock costs, particularly through these higher-cost assets which perhaps have most or more to benefit? Thanks."},{"end_time":"3095750","segment_id":85,"speaker":"Francesco Gattei","start_time":"3048140","text":"On the capex, reduction as I mentioned mainly is a postponement activity. Additionally, a component that we mentioned about improving the reduction of an amount. If you want to have a split in the range of 500 to 600 million, we are referring you could say that 200 to 250 million is related to the postponement of the activity and the rest are structural variations. You have to consider that we have contingency in our plan. So part of the activity that we present has already an implicit impact of possibility to manage flotation. So it is not a magic solution that we have, but sometimes it's just a matter to execute and to implement the contingency that we have inside.

The possibility to have certain saving that we mentioned about the lower scenario, the portfolio improvement, etc. Is something that are already generating the result. Clearly it requires also the time for executing the project. You have to consider that the economic benefit is larger than the cash flow benefit because clearly the economic cut will be or the improvement is something that has higher value, but is clearly captured within the 12 months that are ending within December.

The volatility in the current market is that one day you have a drop by 5%, then there is a rebound of 2 or 3%. There is another tweet and a lot of things are counter to it is very difficult to understand what where are the fundamentals and where are the psychology of the market. So this strong balance sheet gives us the opportunity to select the best levers, in order not to impact, to harm. To harm to match our strategy execution, to have different opportunities, clearly to execute whatever we like, and also to keep some additional levers out for the bad times. These bad times will come out. So this is clearly something that for us is a unique time we had and is a great. Is a great chance to be effective but clearly also to be vigilant on what is going on and not, let's say, to relying on a positive expectation, a positive scenario. In terms of buyback. You know that we are approving the buyback under the. With a. With a policy that we have presented during the next agm, then we start to buy and we will see also the time when the condition will have and we will execute. But I cannot anticipate what is the pace of execution because clearly this is part of the rule of the game. There is a clear advantage or interest in buying back at a lower price.

For the duration of the call you will be in listen-only mode. However, at the end of the call you will have the opportunity to ask questions by pressing star and one on your telephoneone keypad. Should anyone need assistance during the conference call, they may signal operator by pressing star and zero on your telephone. I am now handing you over to your hosts to begin today's conference. Thank you. Thank you. Good afternoon. Our February Capital Market update emphasized the speed and scale at which we had been progressing our strategy Quarter one maintained the pace and recent events have confirmed why our clarity of strategic view a speed of action is so critical. We are creating value, leveraging our competitive strength in the upstream, strengthEning and diversifying the company, fixing and then performing activities, materially strengthEning our balance sheet, all while offering a competitive and resilient return to investors. Reviewing the important strategic highlights of the quarter and year to date, growth is an important feature in our plan in the upstream In March Johan Castberg began production and will add 66,000 barrels per day of oil production at Plateau for VAR as it targets over 400,000 barrels per day by the fourth quarter. Castberg is the first of the five major startups due this year with Valderiks in Norway, Agogo and NGC in Angola plus Congo and Gina Krog phase 2 to follow, setting us up for a strong 2026 in the transition business. PlEnitude, has completed the construction of its 200 megawatt battery in Texas and acquired 245 MW in its share of photovoltaic and storage in California while Eni Live began production of SAF at its new 400,000 tonne per year facility at Gela in Sicily. We are also realizing significant value through the investment of aligned capital and into our transition businesses and the valorization of our industry leading exploration activity via the dual model. We had closely agreed increase in AP's stake in plEnitude to 10% with an additional cash of 209 million Euro at the end of March. We also closed the increase in KKR stake in Nili to 30% with an additional cash in of 601 million Euro in April. This followed the 2.97 billion we collected at the beginning of March. Furthermore, we have received non binding offer for additional stakes in PlEnitude, that could take aligned investment to 25 30%. We consider around 70% a majority any stake in both our major transition business as broadly the right level for the time being in the upstream. Also in March we announced a major dual exploration valorization of with the agreement to sell stakes in Baleen in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Congo LNG in the Republic of Congo to Vitol, for a cash in of around $2.7 billion expected to complete later this year. Our satellite model is an important feature of our business and in the upstream In February we announced an MOU with partners to combine assets with a mixed component of growth and value in Indonesia and Malaysia. This is really a significant development for Eni, creating a new and highly material regional satellite in an important part of the world with a strong partner and with the added opportunity of some cash valorization alongside. We expect to move to a definitive agreement around the middle of this year with the completion before the end of 2025. Structural response in some of our legacy activities are also required as the energy evolves. The transformation of Versalis over the next four five years is a major positive source of self help amounting to more than 1 billion euro per year EBITDA improvement by 2030. We have positive news to report here as well with the agreement reached with the institution and the unions on the details of our plan. We closed Brindisi, the first of the remaining two steamcrackers at the end of March and Priolo will be shut down before the end of this year. Our strategy is designed to create a stronger, more profitable and more Resilient company. Our first quarter results demonstrate this net income 1.4 billion euro is up around 60% quarter on quarter in a very similar scenario setting upstream production was in line with our expectation as 2024 divestment impacts work through seasonal factors play out and we weigh the positive impact of the startups that will contribute to our full year expectation of around 1.7 million barrels per day average. At the segment level, EMP performed an EBITDA of 3.3 billion euro, almost offsetting lower crude and production year on year helped by lower expenses and efficiency gains and the benefit of portfolio grading. GGP's results reflect the normal seasonal strength and were essentially in line with last year. An Eni Live and Plenitude reported pro-forma results consistent with our full year expectations. Once respective seasonalities take into account, Eni Live was impacted by the deterioration in the biofuel margins year on year and also lower bio refinery utilization, albeit by refining. EBITDADA remained positive. This was partially offset by positive evolution of our marketing operation, planning to record a 3% EBITDADA improvement year over year supported by strong retail results and rising renewable generation. In our transformation activity, both refining and chemical were loss making. Refining results reflect the weaker margin year on year and lower throughputs over the closure of Livorno plus the extended turnaround of Sanazaro in the quarter. Our continued losses in Chemical reflect the challenging scenario in Europe that we consider to be a structural feature and confirm our action to restructure and transform this business. Cash flow before working capital of Euro 3.4 billion in the quarter were consistent with our full year guidance of 13 billion euro a $75 per barrel. The cash tax rate was around 30% in line with normal levels and dividends received were in line with associated net income. CapEx in the quarter was 1.9 billion Euro, a little below the run rate of 9 billion Euro in the February guidance. Valuation and divestment proceed net of acquisitions in the quarter total 3 billion euro and including cash in for our transition satellites we repurchased 386 million euro shares in this quarter completing our 2 billion euro 2024 program. We expect to begin the 2025 1.5 billion euro buyback program after the shareholder approval in May. Balance sheet leverage was 18%, 4% lower than the four year last quarter despite a weaker dollar adding 1 percentage point, while our pro forma leverage incorporating agreed transactions still to close stood at 12%, an improvement of 3% percentage point from end 2024 and the minimum in our history. Volatility and cyclicity is a recurring feature of this industry. Every two, three years we are impacted by an external event, so it is a really normal course of business. Our company needs to be prepared, as it should be, to leverage the cyclical upswing. Given the current scenario, it is worth reviewing our balance sheet in a little more detail. In the past five quarters we have announced over 9 billion euro in tail asset divestment, dual exploration, valorization and aligned external investment into our transition oriented business. We have executed faster and for greater value than we and certainly the market expected. Moving quickly to lower our leverage, an additional element of protection is provided by our satellites. The model not only enables us to raise capital and self finance our growth while highlighting the valuation multiples related to transition business or specific upstream geography such as Norway, but it also strengthens our resilience during downturn phases. On one end we are able to contain our leverage through targeted business valorisation. On the other, the availability of autonomous entities capable of containing price downturns with their own balance sheets allows us to secure more stable cash flow via dividends and hence we are less affected by market volatility. Our consolidated balance sheet is just about the strongest in our history. At the end of the quarter we had over 28 billion euro financial asset and now draw committed lines and we have lengthened maturities by more than two years. Over the past two years we estimate that our net cost of net debt in 2025 will be below 1.5%. This position will enable us to continue to balance pursuing our strategy, remaining resilient and flexible and deliver our returns to shareholders. When we discussed our plan and four year strategy, we emphasized the value in the consistency of in our approach. We have also confirmed our dividend at 1.05 Euro and the share buyback totaling 1.5 billion Euro itself a minimum floor that we are committed to maintaining even under adverse market scenarios and we need to be nimble and responsive to the changing condition. The work we have done on the balance sheets are passed significantly, but there are also further measures we will now begin to take to reinforce our financial position without compromising our medium long term objective of our investment proposition. We have identified over 2 billion Euro of initial actions to enhance our free cash flow positions and lowering our cash neutrality by around $15 per bar including additional portfolio upside, selected capex rescheduling over the coming months, active working capital management aimed at enhancing cash recovery and structural cost optimization initiative. Together these actions further enhance our financial position and the risk shareholder distribution. In summary, the additional financial trends we have introduced into ENI over the past year, the intrinsic resilience of the model we have built and the additional options and levers we are available mean we can maintain underlying strategy and also confirm the full distribution policy we have announced. With the current scenario headwinds, we are focused on delivering our underlying performance and leveraging our portfolio optionality to offset cash flow impacts and deliver our distribution commitments. We therefore can confirm our full year production outlook of 1.7 million barrels per day. We also confirm our profitability guidelines for GGP in alive and plEnitude. At our lowered scenario assumption we expect to generate 11 billion euros of cash flow from operation a little better underlying than our sensitivities imply. We expect to offset this impact with the cash mitigation measure I described including net CAPEX to below 6 billion Euro. Therefore, we can also confirm leverage between 0.15 0.2 in 2025 within the 0.1 and 0.2 plan range. We are very satisfied with our progress in 2025 year to date both on the strategic and financial sides. The macro scenario has deteriorated, is volatile and Uncertain. But the action we are taking and flexibility we have mean we are in a position to resist its full impact. We can therefore advance our strategy and deliver on our shareholder commitments. With that I conclude my remarks and welcome any questions you may have. Thank you, Francesco. We will now open to questions. Francesco is joined by anytop management and we will attempt to get around to answer all the questions you may have as a courtesy to everybody who participates. Can we keep it to two questions and then hopefully we can get through everybody in the time allocated. We're going to start with the first question. It comes from Alejandro Vigil from Santander. Alejandro. Thank you, John. And thank you Francesco for taking my questions and congratulations for the performance in this first quarter. The two questions I have are: About the guidance of production the 1.7 million barrels per day, your thoughts on the discussions about Kazakhstan, OPEC plus quotas and if you think there is some Risk coming from this situation. And the second question is about Eni Life and the outlook for margins. Thank you for these spreads that you have added to the release. I think it's very useful but I am Very interested in the outlook for the Margin evolution in the coming quarters in Eni Live. Thank you. I leave the floor to Guido Brusco for the first answer and Stefano Ballista for the one related to Eni Live. Well, as far as the production outlook is concerned as you know, we have as anticipated also by Francesco we have five significant startup two in Angola, two in Norway and one in Congo. So our production will grow over time to hit the guidance we gave Regarding Kazakhstan. So far neither the operator of the asset nor the shareholder and the contracting company have been engaged by the authority for any production cuts. Yes, thank you for the question Talking about biofuel view well, first of all this is a year of oversupply. This is something well known Rough Number is about 2 million oversupply is supply versus demand in the first quarter we saw demand, expected growth in demand and we will deep dive a little bit has not come yet and reason is that actually players have the whole year to satisfy obligations and second reason actually there are some uncertainties in the US that we expect to be clearly defined moving forward on demand is worth to highlight the sustainable aviation fuel 2% target for the EU pretty much in this first half didn't come through. It is expected for the second half, and the reasons pretty much are twofold the chance to get to satisfy the yearly demand and second logistic facility to be in place about us it's important to highlight that low carbon fuel Standard target of an increase GHG reduction to 30% at the beginning of the year expected 1st of April has been delayed given to technical, let me say request from the Office of Administrative Law of California. And now it is expected well, until some weeks ago was beginning of September. Now it's expected beginning of July as CARB has already given a review of these technical aspects. So overall we see a path of margin increasing thanks to this rebalancing pathway we are viewing. I have to say clearly it's very relevant that we focus on value, not on volume. This is a clear strategic approach on an oversupplied market. This is what we are doing. We are definitely focused on value, even reducing in some case volume. The more the system will move in this direction, the better is going to be the improvement trajectory we are seeing and foreseeing. Thank you. Thanks Alejandro. The next question is from Biraj Bakhtarya at RBC. Biraj,. Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Francesco. You touched on obviously the strength of the balance sheet and the progress you've made there, which is obviously now looking in good shape. I was wondering, we have obviously seen the environment deteriorate a little bit more. You've touched on some of the smaller changes you've made to your capital program. But I guess the question is what will you need to see price wise or signal wise to adjust your, you know, activities more materially there. And then just to follow up for Stefano on sustainable aviation in in late March, there was a joint statement from your customers, the airlines arguing about concerns on availability and then the cost of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) suggesting these mandates were not realistic or achievable. So I just wanted your thoughts on whether it's is it reasonable or realistic to assume that these mandates could be relaxed this year or do you expect policymakers to hold firm that. Thank you. Yes. About the CapEx and the reaction to the price signals. Clearly we think that at the end of the day, once there is a deterioration the scenario, you have the opportunity substantially to use different levers that you let's say prioritize in terms of effectiveness in terms also on impacts in in future in future trends of the of the company and the target that the company has set. For this reason we have, you've seen that we have announced that this 2 billion of improvement in in cash that is for around an alpha or around and half is related to capex and cost improvement. So shifting certain investment, postponing or extending the execution of certain activity efficiency. There is also a natural trend related to a lower market scenario that will imply a lower cost in executing the activity and the remaining part is related split half and half between a portfolio improvement and the working capital effectiveness or a new action in term of valorisation on working capital or stocks and managing this this activity this give us more flexibility for a worse scenario in case it be necessary I would say that there is no special or strict rules what is the price that will imply a change in our CapEx profile? Clearly if there is a further deterioration of this scenario we will continue to apply even more lever including the one that you are referring capex but also other activities that we can expedite and will contribute to cash even in a lower scenario. So I don't have a specific answer what I can say there is flexibility in our plan even to adjust to lower prices Then I leave to Stefano. Yes, thank you Francesco and thanks for the question. Actually short answer is no, we definitely don't think there is any chance to not have in place this target, this is a mandatory target, 2% within the end of the year and if you don't fulfill it, there will be a carryover of the target next year and and a penalty as well. Let me add just a couple of comments on the topic as a whole actually SAF capacity it's in place in Europe and not only Europe actually we have also some capacity capacity in the US and in China as well in Europe just to make an example we got Gela with up to 400k tonnes per year and we just start up production beginning of this year. So the current mandate of 2% that equal about a million, a million point two as capacity to be definitely fulfilled. So this is the first comment. Second comment, the target is on fuel suppliers, not on airlines, and even the matter of logistics actually it's not there because for a transition period you can fulfill the mandate in a single airport. You don't need to be physically blending biojet in each airport. This gives a lot of, let's say, flexibility in having it done. And then let me say as last comment, probably in terms of target I would have a slightly different perspective now we got 2% in place up to 2030 and then 66%. So it's three times just from one year to the next in order to have, let's say a proper development of the investments actually would be a proper approach to get a sort of step up along the way and in that way you can let's say have a balanced approach between supply and demand. So there is, I mean space to work together with airlines to couple with the energy transition and the GHG reduction targets in an effective and efficient way. Thank you very much. Thanks Bharaj. The next questions come from Josh Stone at UBS. Josh, are you online? Hi John and good afternoon. Two questions please. One, I wanted to come back talk about asset sales. Could you talk about how confident you are in closing your sale to Vitol and maybe just characterize the market to selling assets. You talked about some non-binding offers for Plenitude. Are there still live discussions happening there and how are you thinking about that? Is it better to sell now or, or maybe even weights for higher values? Maybe just talk about Plenitude and what you're thinking on that. And then the second question on Namibia. There was some news last week that you hit hydrocarbons at your latest well. Well I think that's now two from two. So maybe you can just talk about the next steps and what you can share so far what you've learned from your campaign there. Thank you. Thank you. The first very fast clearly asset sales we are extremely confident first of all because we already cashed in an additional 600 in early April and 11th of April. That is the amount that is related to the top up of the 5% on the any live KKR deal. Then we are working on this plenitude potential transaction 15, 20% the the non binding offer are there. There is I would say a strong competition pressure. I don't see any, let's say, loss of valuation under the current market. Also because this is clearly a deal that has a long term perspective and also eventually will be helped by a reduction or expectation or lower interest rate in the future on the deal on Africa, West Africa with all we have all the documents ready and signed and we are just waiting for the various approval that are requiring this activity. There is no mock provision that will impede to proceed. So I would say that almost 90 95% of our plan is already in our end or with a very positive perception of its execution in term of Namibia. I leave now to Guido to provide all the updates. Your question was quite timely as we just released a few minutes ago a press release where we confirmed the discovery in Namibia. The well successfully penetrated the target and the reservoir is showing good petrophysical properties. No water oil, no water contact. We made an intensive acquisition campaign, wild line loggings, hydrocarbon samples, sidewall cores and in addition to that we made also a well test and we achieved a flow rate in excess of 11,000 barrel of oil per day which Was surface constrained. The oil is light with limited associated gas and very low inert gas. So very positive, very interesting. More assessment and more analysis, of course, will have to be made. So the well will be temporarily plugged and abandoned and the rig will be released. And then we assess the full size. We'll assess with the operator and the other partner the full size of the discovery. Thanks, Guido. Thanks, Josh. Good timing on that question. So we're now going to move on to. Giacomo. Giacomo Romeo from Jefferies. Giacomo, are you there? Yes, thank you. And can I just thank you as well for the incremental disclosures in these quarters reports. They're very much welcome. Two questions for me. First one on the buyback: Today you reconfirmed 1.5 billion buyback. At the lower macro scenario. This effectively stretches your cash flow from operations (CFFO) payout at the upper end of your new range. Of a new policy. What happens if the macro deteriorates further? Are you comfortable going above that 40% payout, Francesco? And second question is on the agreement the MOU you signed with the YPF on LNG in Argentina. Can you talk a bit about the attractiveness of Argentina as potential energy exporters, and will you consider integrating these upstream and looking for assets there or are you happy just. We're just happy with the share in the project. Yeah. Thank you. I will reply to the first question: then I leave back to Guido for the Argentinian questions about the buyback. Clearly you know that once we set our distribution policy and the amount starting level for the buyback, we set that in a way that will be a flaw and therefore we are going to execute this. Clearly we give the reference in terms of percentage of cash flow distribution, but we have all the levers to keep this, this distribution policy and buyback affordable in our balance sheet because there is a lot of other tools that are not just the percentage of cash flow from operations, but also the capability as we are seeing in this maneuver, to balance this distribution also with free cash flow improvement in terms of portfolio or in term of working capital. And clearly the leverage level is another factor that have to be considered once you have to manage the fluctuation of prices. So I think there is no issue at all on confirming this 1.5 billion even in a lower scenario. Clearly eventually you could accelerate or slow down a bit the pace of of buyback, but this is part of the normal activity that we are able to execute within the almost one year of, of of the. Of the buyback plan. I leave now to Guido for The YPF deal? Yeah. The Vaca Muerta basin, as you know, is the second-largest in the world shale gas field. And the Argentina LNG project is an integrated project from the upstream up to the midstream, and the export of the LNG,. This has the objective to hit more than 30 million tonnes per annum by the early 2030. It has different phases, three phases which will be run in parallel. Eni and YPF signed an MoU to execute one of these three phases which would reach a total of 12 million tonnes per annum. We're joining YPF who has a very strong and deep country knowledge on the unconventional upstream of Vaca Muerta. They are operating the South Set for decades, so they know pretty well the subsurface, and all development and operation activities. While on our side zni, we are recognized as a fast track and low cost project operator, and we would bring our experience and leadership, particularly on floating LNG projects. We are looking at this Argentina LNG project and full value chain to complement our portfolio of LNG and also to reach our strategic target, of 20 million tons per annum. And we think that the the combination of the expertise of YPF on the upstream of Vaca Muerta and the expertise of ENI on the midstream floating LNG will set this venture for success. Thanks, Guido. Thanks, Giacomo. We're going to move now to Matt Smith from Bank of America. Matt, are you there? Hi there. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. The first, I wanted to come back to the capex cuts that you sort of laid out today. You've sort of listed optimization and postponement of projects as one of the sources of the reduction in capex. I just wanted to understand which projects you're specifically referring to. And I guess my broader question was if the current commodity price scenario was to extend into next year, would any of these projects not just be postponed but be canceled? So that would be the first question and then the second one, I wanted to come back to Namibia if I could, noting the information that you put out on the latest well today. I mean, given you have had additional time in the lab with the first discovery, I just wondered if you could compare or contrast them. Is it the correct read that the second discovery has better characteristics than the first? Or what additional insights could you give us there, please? Thank you. On the CapEx, on the CapEx optimization, there is no major project that we can point out specifically is a broader activity, some exploration activities, some production optimization activities related to EV charging, related eventually to the rebranding of our service stations. So it is a spread around across activities with marginal impact on a specific on a specific project. So you shouldn't expect any delay on the key and most important projects. About Namibia if we want to. Regarding Namibia, it is too premature to make. As I said when I spoke about it just a few minutes ago, we need to assess the full size of the discovery. It's really premature. We just finished the well testing. We are still in a phase where we have to do some work and I would also recommend to refer to the operators to to get more insights and information on the discovery itself. Thank you. Thanks Matt. We're going to move now to Alessandro Pozzi. Alessandro? Alessandro, are you there? Okay, we're going to move on now, Alessandro, if you want to come back on, you can. We can move now to Michele Della Vigna from Goldman Sachs. Michele? Thank you John and congratulations on the strong results. Two questions if I may. First, I wanted to understand, with the new Cyprus gas development, when you expected production to come through and if you thought that could effectively revive exports from Damietta and effectively make Egypt once again an exporting country of LNG. And then secondly on the Indonesia Malaysia combination, I see you continue to progress the negotiations there. I was wondering if you expect any kind of cash contribution for that deal or if it's likely to be a pure a combination of assets. Thank you. On the Indonesia Malaysia, clearly I can tell you what is the experience that we have in this kind of combination. Once you set up the new entity, the new company, you clearly design not only the business plan with the investments and the different or relative ratio between the parties, but it also a financial plan that is a result of the addition of this kind of asset and, therefore, the capability for the new entity to leverage on this asset for more financial capability, and therefore there is generally a contribution that is related to the possibility to have certain dividend up front that will help to generate cash, more cash than in a standalone situation. And then on Cyprus, if we may. Cyprus we are working for an FID within the year with the partners and the two host governments, it will be a subsea tie-back to the Egyptian facilities. So we expect an execution time between two and two and a half a year from the fid. So if we will be able to make an FID by the end of this year, production may come sometime between Q4, 27, Q1, Q1 2028. Of course to have Egypt again as a net exporter. A few more things need to happen. There is a growing confidence on the ability of Egypt to kick out more Investment they continue to pay their outstanding receivables. So there is more activity in general not just from ENI but also from other operator. And there is also again a restart of the journey on the increase of the capacity of renewables, which will free up more gas for exports. So the combination of these two things together with the new development and the Cyprus gas may position Egypt again in a couple of years as a net exporter again. But this is the not just linked to the Cyprus gas. Thank you. Thanks Michele. We found Alessandro. So Alessandro, if you're on, you can ask your questions now. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you for taking the questions. I have two. I think the first one is about the cost-saving initiatives of 2 billion over 2 billion parties CAPEX. I think there is other large initiatives regarding working capital and other costs. I was wondering if you can give us maybe more colors on those as well. And with regard to Argentina, I was wondering what is the level of investment that you're planning to make over the next few years and whether potentially you're looking to invest in upstream? I guess so. And the type of maybe production levels that you expect from the country when phase one will be online. Thank you. About the cash initiative I mentioned before, Almost more than 1 billion is related to the CapEx and cost improvement. CapEx as we said are mainly related to postponed a certain activity that could be extended without major impacts on big project, but just related to certain activity that could be say executed in a longer time in terms of cost. There will be a natural reduction in term of cost also related to a lower scenario. And we do expect that there is also benefit from the portfolio activity of the remaining 1 billion that we said there is almost half so around the 500 million is related to the portfolio improvement in terms of less cash out and better value on the potential cash inflow. And on the other side, the remaining part is related to the cash initiatives that are management of working capital. This is a maximum I can describe. You. If you want to describe Argentina? Guido? Yeah, Argentina is an integrated project. So basically we will be all along the value chain from the upstream to midstream balanced ideally so having the same equity in both sides. The project of course is in a very early stage, but the phase three, the phase that we are assessing with YPF of 12 million tonnes per annum will have cost around $20 billion. Of course from I'm including all cost from upstream to the transportation to the midstream, and liquefaction. Is that included in your four-year CapEx guidance or is it on top? We are speaking about an MOU that is still to be clearly designed, defined with a lot of activity that have to be fine-tuned later on. So it's not yet in. Thank you. Thanks, Alessandro. We're now going to move to Peter Lowe at Redburn. Peter, hi. Yeah, thanks. The first question was just on the tax rate in the quarter a bit lower than we expected. Can you perhaps just outline what was driving that and then maybe what we should expect for the rest of the year. Will it kind of return to that 50 to 55% range? And then the second question was just on production in the quarter, particularly gas. There's quite a large sequential step down. I think you call out disposals in the release, but I thought those were more oil weighted. So I just wanted to check was anything like maintenance or turnarounds kind of impacting that gas number in the quarter. Thanks. Yeah. About the tax rate, clearly the tax rate in this quarter was positively impacted by the structure of the results. Is a quarter where you have the benefit of contribution from GGP, from Plenitude for the power and this is lowering for generally, let's say higher prices of both oil and gas. So from the geographies of even in upstream that have a lower tax rate. So this quarter is a quarter that of a tax rate that you could generally expect once there is this mix of contributors, the trend for the year in a scenario that we lowered in terms of mainly of oil prices will see this tax rate increasing towards the upper end of the expectation. 55% could be a rough estimate where you could see the results coming. So clearly the quarter will contribute, but we do expect an increase in the coming months because the price of oil that we are designing or are planning is lower and the contribution of the lower tax rate businesses will be less impactful. And then I leave for the gas. For the gas and for production in general. If we compare with the, I mean sequentially from quarter four to quarter one, the decrease is mainly driven by lower entitlements in some countries where we have gas production, some PSA effect in Libya, Indonesia, and Algeria and some M&A impact in the US. Thank you. Thank you, Peter. I'm now going to move to Irene. Mona at Bernstein. Irene. Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. First, a quick question on cash flow from your recently announced recent disposals. How much would you expect to close and book in the second quarter, please? And then secondly on emp, your underlying per barrel EBIT margin has improved sequentially quite a lot given it was in a similar oil price environment. You have indicated that around half of your planned disposals in the four year plan is from upstream. So, my question is, can we anticipate that as you continue high grading the portfolio that unit margin improvement can continue further and of course it is structural. So presumably also your oil price sensitivity may change over time. Thank you. On the disposal side, on this quarter and second quarter we have already cashed in 600 million that are related to the KKR deal. We are potentially expecting the closing of the West African deal but that could slip also to the third quarter taking into account of the different authorities that have to be involved and therefore is something that could occur during the summer let's say, and we do expect clearly that we are able to proceed to the next step for the plenitude dealer. So this will not clearly be a cash-in date but will be in this quarter potentially a conclusion of the tender activity that we are executing. Yeah, the improvement of the EBIT per barrel and cash flow per barrel as we anticipated. Also in our Capital Market Update is structural as we are grading our portfolio, developing I mean high-value barrels and disposing of lower-value barrels. So it's a structural phenomena which over time should continue of course. Thanks Irene for your questions. Thank you. Thanks. We're going to move to Henry Tarr at Berenberg. Henry? Henry, are you there? Okay, Mr. Tarr, your line is open. Okay Henry, if you can reconnect and we can come around to your question. But we'll move now to Paul Redman at bnp. Paul. Hi John and team, thank you very much for your time. Two questions from me. First, focus is on the cash flow mitigation chart and we've got a bunch of buckets here. I just wanted to work out if any of these are structural reductions or whether these are one off impacts that we could see a reverse impact in 2026. And secondly, just to look at the refining business, it's the second sequential loss for that business. Just trying to work out your outlook for the year for that business. Do we expect any change in margins, any exchange changes in utilization rates as we go through 2025? Thank you very much. On the cash initiative. These are clearly structural because except for the few delays that we mentioned that are spread around between executing certain activities, the rebranding of Eni Live stations or EV charge or certain activity, all the rest are related to factoring in working capital management. That means substantially is something that is not absorbed during the year and the cost reduction that as we said also is related to the improvement and also the scenario that we are facing that clearly has a lower cost of energy overall. So I think these are mainly structural changes and structural improvement including the portfolio variations that we mentioned in terms of higher valuation or higher stakeholders the refinery. I think that the Pinot or. Yes please, yes, thanks Francesco. About the refining losses in the first. Quarter, this is due to the drop. Of the margin and the fact that. We added during the quarter the start. Of the maintenance in Taranto refinery and then upset in FCC of Sannazzaro. What we expect is to increase the. Refinery utilization in the starting from the second quarter and while we expect that margins will remain slightly better than today but not as bullish as last year. Thanks Pino. Henry, I think we've got you back. Thanks. Thanks for taking the question. So two questions just to come back to any live Is the contribution from the margins from the straight biofuel side positive at this point for you or are you essentially making all of the money on the marketing side rather than the actual manufacturing of the fuel? Is the first question and then the second is just on the cash flow. So lease interest payments is Q1 a good run rate for the rest of the year at around 370 million. Thank you. I leave to Stefano for the first question then I come back to the second one. Yeah, thank you for the question. The contribution margin is positive, albeit slightly. Clearly related to the current scenario. As I mentioned before we definitely focus on value and not on volume so we prefer to avoid production that is not going to be accretive in terms of value. I have to add actually that the integrated approach that characterize any live give us the chance to let's say optimize margin thanks to our captive market, and this is going to give an extra contribution compared let me say to the pure market value. On the lease impact over the I would expect an increase during the year clearly also because there are certain startup of initiative and project that will attract additional leads. So, this quarter is, let's say, a proxy but it's still a bit light towards what is the running rate during the next quarters. Okay, thanks Francesca. Thanks Henry. We're going to move to Matt Lofting from JP Morgan. Matt. Thanks all for taking the questions. First I just wanted to come back to the capital allocation changes that Eni made this morning and particularly gross capex. It looks like you sort of effectively put through the lower part of a 5 to 10% reduction in full year gross CAPEX versus what you outlined in Feb. If you aggregate everything up, can you just share a sense of how much of that is activity related versus sort of finding underlying efficiency measures. And then secondly, following up on the comments earlier on refining, if you take refining and Versalis combined, clearly still a challenge in Q1. Are there any signs of more recently of any improvement in margins to the degree that you're seeing some degree of lower feedstock costs, particularly through these higher-cost assets which perhaps have most or more to benefit? Thanks. On the capex, reduction as I mentioned mainly is a postponement activity. Additionally, a component that we mentioned about improving the reduction of an amount. If you want to have a split in the range of 500 to 600 million, we are referring you could say that 200 to 250 million is related to the postponement of the activity and the rest are structural variations. You have to consider that we have contingency in our plan. So part of the activity that we present has already an implicit impact of possibility to manage flotation. So it is not a magic solution that we have, but sometimes it's just a matter to execute and to implement the contingency that we have inside. Then I leave it to Adriano and Pino for the answer about downstream. For the chemical side, in terms of demand we expect a slightly improvement in line with the seasonality because normally. The second quarter is better than Q1. But to be honest, the current scenario is still on the trough of the cycle. In terms of demand for sure we expect an improvement in terms of cost of utilities because virgin NAFTA is expected to reduce right now in the second quarter we expect also a lower TTF in thermal gas. And we know that we are very. We consume quite a lot of energy for the chemical sector. So we expect an improvement in thermal margins. Margin for the rest of the year. On the chemical side. And I leave Pino for the refinery. Yes, on the refinery side we expect. A slightly improve in the margin in. The mid part of the year, mainly. Due to the driving season, but not. So far in complexity. The refining margin we expect that remain. Not so bullish because of the market that is quite stable. Thanks Pino. We're going to now move and thank you everybody for respecting the two questions. We're getting through this nice and quickly, so we're going to move to Massimo Bonasoli at Equitas. Massimo, good afternoon. Thank you. And two clarification questions for me. The first on the 2 billion mitigating initiatives, could you give us a broad time frame for the savings to be, Realized and the eventual one of cost. Associated with the savings. The second question, on the outlook for GGP, you mentioned the upside of over 1 billion. Could you shed some light on the market condition needed to improve the guidance and to renegotiate the contracts versus current conditions? Thank you. First of all, the 2 billion is free cash flow impact. It means that it is executed within the year and completed within the year. So there are actions that are, they say captured immediately, so they postponed the activity in line with the execution of that activity. The possibility to have certain saving that we mentioned about the lower scenario, the portfolio improvement, etc. Is something that are already generating the result. Clearly it requires also the time for executing the project. You have to consider that the economic benefit is larger than the cash flow benefit because clearly the economic cut will be or the improvement is something that has higher value, but is clearly captured within the 12 months that are ending within December. On the yes scenario and the gas. So talking about the upside case for ggp, you pointed out to two elements which are actually the ones that we also are pursuing. One is the renegotiation and negotiation of. Our supply and sales contracts. This is, as you know, a feature, a normal feature of the business. We have few rediscussion ongoing and I would say that probably the summer will be, you know, the period in which we might see some of those completing. And so I mean, you know, depending on the outcome of these discussions, this could have some value unlock in terms of market conditions. As you know, we are fairly well defended from the downside risk of flat price. We have some upside linked to clearly flat price increase instead. And the other elements that actually we like in terms of producing more value is spreads and volatility. Low geographical spreads, oil up spreads, summer winter spreads, those are part of the volatility that if those happens, we will be able to capture. Thank you. Thanks Massimo. Thanks Christian. We're the last two, so we're going to move first to Kim Fustier at hsbc. Kim, hi, good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. I have two, please. First, on Venezuela, could you comment on any impact on your operations or your ability to lift crude cargo from the revocation of export licenses and secondary tariffs on the country. And then lastly, just a quick housekeeping question. You've cashed about 3 billion euros in the first quarter from the sale of Enulife to KKR. But we can't actually see the disposal proceeds in the cash flow statement. Could you point out where we should look? That would be helpful. Thank you. On Venezuela, Guido Yeah, no, Venezuela, as. You know, we primarily have gas production. We produce gas for domestic market and to feed the gas-fired power plant for civil consumption. And we have been paid in kind in the past. So now we are engaging the US authorities to find ways to be paid while being compliant with the new regime imposed by the US. And we are confident that by the year end we will find a way to honor our commitment towards the population and honor also the compliance with the U.S. sanctions. And Kim, I will come back to you on the cash flow statement and the structure. The cash is in there, but it is not straightforward. So I can do that for you, but we will do that offline if that's okay. Thanks. We can move now to the last question which is Lydia Rainforth at Barclays. Lydia? Thank you, John and good afternoon. Two final questions if I could. The first one, these are both big picture but given where the balance sheet is and it's much stronger than it was even a year ago, but in previous kind of downturns, it does give you a more privileged position into how. You respond to volatility than in the past. So I'm just actually asking you to reflect on that. Does having that strength of balance sheet impact how you think about how you respond and is there opportunities that it opens up? And then secondly, I hear everything you. Say about the cash management, the mitigation measures that you're putting in place and hopefully when you start the buyback it actually helps the relative share price performance even further. But given where the share price is, do do you ever start thinking about leaning into lean into the balance sheet a bit more and buying back even more shares just given where the share price actually is. Thanks in terms of clearly on the leverage and the privilege to have probably to be the unique company inside the peer group that probably will be will reduce its leverage in the current, in the current quarters on coming quarters, thanks to the execution of a strategy that is already anticipating potential downturn and as a structural robustness in is in its structure, I think that will give us the opportunity to manage the volatility. The volatility in the current market is that one day you have a drop by 5%, then there is a rebound of 2 or 3%. There is another tweet and a lot of things are counter to it is very difficult to understand what where are the fundamentals and where are the psychology of the market. So this strong balance sheet gives us the opportunity to select the best levers, in order not to impact, to harm. To harm to match our strategy execution, to have different opportunities, clearly to execute whatever we like, and also to keep some additional levers out for the bad times. These bad times will come out. So this is clearly something that for us is a unique time we had and is a great. Is a great chance to be effective but clearly also to be vigilant on what is going on and not, let's say, to relying on a positive expectation, a positive scenario. In terms of buyback. You know that we are approving the buyback under the. With a. With a policy that we have presented during the next agm, then we start to buy and we will see also the time when the condition will have and we will execute. But I cannot anticipate what is the pace of execution because clearly this is part of the rule of the game. There is a clear advantage or interest in buying back at a lower price. That is a normal logic. I think that we have ended. I don't know if John, you have something else to conclude? We have. Francesco. That's all the questions done. Thank you everybody for attending the call. Thank you for your questions. Thank you for the speed and directness. We got through that. I think it worked very well. Wishing you a happy end to the week. Good luck for next week and speak to you soon. Thanks a lot. Bye.","transcript_id":"ccc84ed9-00b7-44b9-8ff7-3d007a853b89","type":"NON_LIVE"}],"updated_at":"2025-04-24T16:57:23Z"},{"audio":{"content_type":"audio/mpeg","quality":"192kbps","url":"https://cdn.kscope.io/ks-trsc-634cec0804569e20d88766a.mp3?key=0168e3f5-cb74-4278-8437-b3db550908bb"},"call_id":"634cec0804569e20d88766a","call_title":"Grupo Televisa reports EBITDA growth amid ongoing efficiency initiatives","created_at":"2025-04-30T23:59:55Z","description":"","duration":22,"end_time":"2025-04-30T20:21:55-04:00","exchange":"ALL","figis":["BBG001SNZ1Q7","BBG001S64JP0"],"headline":"Grupo Televisa achieves 5% EBITDA growth as strategic focus on efficiencies and integration drives margin expansion despite revenue challenges.","language":"en","name":"","participants":[{"call_id":"634cec0804569e20d88766a","human_verified":false,"mentions":3,"name":"Alfonso de Angotia","organization":"","participant_id":"6407443b-61f0-4bf8-b6eb-20232fccd0c7","role":"Co Chief Executive Officer of Grupo Televisa"},{"call_id":"634cec0804569e20d88766a","human_verified":false,"mentions":3,"name":"Francisco Valim","organization":"","participant_id":"0efbf4cd-5dfa-4427-8572-4d833488d379","role":"CEO of Cable and Sky"},{"call_id":"634cec0804569e20d88766a","human_verified":false,"mentions":2,"name":"Carlos Phillips","organization":"","participant_id":"f7f75f3f-6b73-4b73-811b-52ef3ee2a6fc","role":"Chief Financial Officer of Grupo Televisa"},{"call_id":"634cec0804569e20d88766a","human_verified":false,"mentions":3,"name":"Livia Balim","organization":"","participant_id":"2b06e357-8ba2-4246-9b27-cb105a5425e5","role":"Unknown"},{"call_id":"634cec0804569e20d88766a","human_verified":false,"mentions":2,"name":"Gustavo Farias","organization":"","participant_id":"6cd4a1bb-ca37-458b-8fb2-845b607e919c","role":"Unknown"},{"call_id":"634cec0804569e20d88766a","human_verified":false,"mentions":1,"name":"Bernardo","organization":"","participant_id":"d58ddf68-360b-4304-a8a0-a701b38bbb1b","role":"Unknown"},{"call_id":"634cec0804569e20d88766a","human_verified":false,"mentions":2,"name":"Dan Goetia","organization":"","participant_id":"67f113ae-b17b-4be9-90f8-3410462abecf","role":"Unknown"},{"call_id":"634cec0804569e20d88766a","human_verified":false,"mentions":2,"name":"Carlos Legaretta","organization":"","participant_id":"9b722a6b-a95b-42d2-a3ea-111fadbce8d3","role":"Unknown"},{"call_id":"634cec0804569e20d88766a","human_verified":false,"mentions":1,"name":"Lisea Mizubata","organization":"","participant_id":"1fd243cf-48ff-4549-8daf-bfe4f11e477b","role":"Equity Analyst at JP Morgan"},{"call_id":"634cec0804569e20d88766a","human_verified":false,"mentions":1,"name":"Mooli","organization":"","participant_id":"e25615f7-6f1c-45a7-9645-c091e01a865e","role":"Unknown"},{"call_id":"634cec0804569e20d88766a","human_verified":false,"mentions":1,"name":"Elsa","organization":"","participant_id":"0b6525a3-dd34-4ec3-9867-112f86e25784","role":"Unknown"},{"call_id":"634cec0804569e20d88766a","human_verified":false,"mentions":1,"name":"Vadim","organization":"","participant_id":"4472300d-07c0-4408-9c2e-25217ea57c5e","role":"Unknown"}],"securities":[{"figi":"BBG000V1C5F1","figi_composite":"BBG000V1C4V6","figi_share_class":"BBG001SNZ1Q7","isin":"CA89531J7868","mic_code":"XTSE","name":"TREVALI MINING CORP","refinitiv_exch_code":"TOR","symbol":"TV"},{"figi":"BBG000BJDPF9","figi_composite":"BBG000BJDPF9","figi_share_class":"BBG001S64JP0","isin":"US40049J2069","mic_code":"XNYS","name":"GRUPO TELEVISA SA-SPON ADR","refinitiv_exch_code":"NYQ","symbol":"TV"}],"start_time":"2025-04-30T19:59:55-04:00","status":"COMPLETED","summary":{"call_id":"634cec0804569e20d88766a","created_at":"2025-04-30T23:59:55Z","language":"","summary":"- Grupo Televisa reported a 5.7% year-on-year decline in segment revenue to 15.1 billion pesos, but improved operating segment income margin by 100 basis points due to efficiency measures and synergies from the integration of EASI and Sky.

At Grupo Televisa, we will continue to focus on attracting and retaining valuable customers to stabilize and potentially grow our Internet subscriber base sequentially throughout this year, execute on the implementation of OPEX and CAPEX efficiencies and conclude the integration between EC and Sky to extract further synergies. This has already contributed to expanding our consolidated operating segment income margin by around 100 basis points in the first quarter, driven by a year-on-year OPEX reduction of around 8%. And we would expect this profitability improvement to remain over the coming quarters and at Televisa Univision. Now that our direct to consumer business VIX has gained scale and achieved profitability, we are confident that additional value can be unlocked through further integration, optimization and unification of both our content business and geographies. Despite some challenges and top line pressure, Televisa Univision\u2019s first quarter operating performance reflected the underlying strength of our content engine and continued scaling of vix. The proactive realignment and optimization of our cost base started at the end of 2024 and our DTC profitability more than offset these headwinds and contributed to adjusted EBITDA growth of 5% year-on-year during the first quarter. Having said that, let me turn the call over to Valim as he will discuss the operating and financial performance of our consolidated assets."},{"end_time":"394720","segment_id":2,"speaker":"Francisco Valim","start_time":"160990","text":"Thank you, Alfonso. Good morning everyone. First, let me walk you through the operating financial performance of our cable operations. We ended March with a network of 19.9 million homes after passing around 13,000 new homes during the quarter. In the first quarter, our monthly churn rate remained in line with our historical average of 2% as we kept executing on our strategy to focus on value customers rather than volume while working on customer retention and satisfaction. Our broadband gross adds improved considerably on a sequential basis, allowing us to deliver disconnections of only around 6,000 subscribers during the first quarter compared to a loss of 85,000 in the fourth quarter of last year. Regarding video, we also experienced stronger gross adds than in the fourth quarter of last year. Therefore, we lost about 73,000 video subscribers in the first quarter compared to the 95,000 disconnections in the fourth quarter of 2024. Of note, our mobile net adds were solid at 36,000 subscribers during the first quarter compared to a full year net adds of 26,000 in 2024. We were able to achieve this because late last year we relaunched a new and innovative MVNO service developed by ZTE, offering enhanced user experience. We are confident that this new service will make our bundles more competitive while allowing us to increase the share of wallet from our existing customers. During the quarter, net revenue from our residential operations of 10.5 billion pesos which accounted for around 91% of total cable revenue, decreased by 3% year-on-year, mainly because we lost some revenue given the cancellation of the Aficionados video package during the second quarter of 2020 and as we had a slightly lower subscriber base. Net revenue from our enterprise operations of 1 billion pesos, which are accounted for around 9% of total cable revenue, declined by 4.5% year-on-year. As in the first quarter 2024, we are concluding an important government contract which translated into higher revenue streams. Moving on to Sky's operating and financial performance, during the fourth quarter we lost 331,000 revenue generating units, mostly coming from prepaid subscribers that had not been recharging their services. Sky first quarter revenue of 2.5 billion pesos, fell by 13.2% year-on-year, mainly driven by a lower subscriber base. To sum up, Segment revenue of 15.1 billion pesos, fell by 5.7 year-on-year while operating segment income of 5.7 billion pesos declined by 3.1%. Our operating segment income margin of 37.8% expanded by 100 basis points year-on-year, mainly driven by the efficiency measures that we have been implementing and synergies from the ongoing integration between EC and Sky. On a sequential basis, our operating segment income for the first quarter already marked a turning point as IT increased by 1.6% quarter on quarter while our operating segment income margin expanded by 180 basis points. Regarding CapEx deployment, our total investment of 1.8 billion pesos during the first quarter fell by around 13% year-on-year. So our CAPEX to sales ratio of 11.8% was around 100 basis points lower than that of the first quarter of 2024. Finally, operating cash flow of cable and sky, which is equivalent to EBITDA minus CAPEX, was 3.9 billion pesos in the first quarter, increasing by 2% year-on-year and accounting for 26% of sales. This basically means that our operating cash flow margin increased by 200 basis points year-on-year."},{"end_time":"697760","segment_id":3,"speaker":"Carlos Phillips","start_time":"394800","text":"Thank you Balim. Now let me walk you through Televisa Univision's first quarter results released last week. The company's first quarter revenue of $1 billion declined by 11% year-on-year while adjusted EBITDA of 345 million dollars increased by 5% excluding the impact from the depreciation of the Mexican peso. Televisa Univision's first quarter revenue decreased by 6% year-on-year due to the absence of the prior year's broadcast of the super bowl in the US and the impact of the renewal cycle with key distribution partners in Mexico. On the other hand, adjusted EBITDA increased by 10% year-on-year reflecting margin expansion expansion driven by the operational optimization plan we implemented in December of last year and continued DTC profitability. Moving on to the details of our revenue performance during the quarter, consolidated advertising revenue decreased by 13% year-on-year or 3% excluding the Super Bowl in the US and the FX impact. In the US advertising revenue was 11% lower as growth in DTC advertising revenue was offset by linear softness and the absence of the prior year's broadcast of the Super Bowl. Excluding the Super Bowl, US advertising revenue declined by 6%. In Mexico, advertising revenue declined by 16% year-on-year driven by the depreciation of the Mexican peso. FX Neutral advertising revenue in Mexico increased by 1% reflecting private sector growth across both linear and etc and the strong performance of sports content including Ligue IMX and the Super Bowl. During the quarter, consolidated subscription and licensing revenue fell by 7% year-on-year but grew 1% excluding the FX impact and and the previously mentioned distribution renewal cycle in Mexico. In the U.S. subscription and licensing revenue increased by 5% driven by Vix's premium tier. In Mexico, subscription and licensing revenue fell by 36% mainly due to the distribution renewal cycle and the depreciation of the Mexican peso. FX neutral subscription and licensing revenue in Mexico decreased by 26%, partially supported by the subscription growth in Vix's premium tier. Turning to Vix, we delivered another quarter of solid growth and profitability and reinforced the strength of our DTC strategy, our advertising video on demand tier continued to scale with double digit growth in reach relative to last year. At the same time, our subscription video on demand tier also achieved double digit subscriber growth even after a recent price increase in the U.S. underscoring the value of our unique offering. All in all, BICS remains well positioned, delivering consistent performance across key metrics while reinforcing our leadership in Spanish language streaming. Finally, at the end of the first quarter, Televisa Univision's leverage ratio was 5.8 times EBITDA compared to 5.9 times by the end of 2024 due to a combination of free cash flow generation and EBITDA growth. Moving on, Let me remind you that on March 18th we used part of the free cash flow generated last year by Grupo Televisa to pay the remaining $219 million principal amount senior notes maturing this year. This payment was hedged at an exchange rate of 17.8 pesos per dollar. Moreover, at the end of the first quarter, Grupo Televisa's leverage ratio of 2.4 times EBITDA compared to 2.5 times by the end of 2024 due to our free cash flow generation of around 2.2 billion pesos, during the quarter. To wrap up, Bernardo and I are confident that our focus on value, customers, efficiencies and ongoing integration between EC and Sky at Grupo Televisa and further integration and operational optimization at Televisa Univision, now that our DTC business has gained scale and achieved profitability, will allow us to create greater value for our shareholders throughout this year.

So obviously we're not forecasting further increments, but we are always focusing on improving margins and that's a recurring theme amongst ourselves. Regarding the 1 million homes passed, typically the first quarter is a slow quarter, but by the end of the year we should reach our target. In terms of our CapEx budget, we are in the 665.

I'll take the second one and then I'll ask Carlos Phillips to take the first one. As to the down Moody's rating downgrade, I can say that as you could see, since the end of Last year of 2024, we have been implementing OPEX efficiencies at Televisa Univision and that is to grow EBITDA this year and reduce leverage despite the expected headwinds to grow revenue. You can see this, that I mean during the first quarter as we managed to grow Televisa Univision's EBITDA by 5% year-on-year. And this is despite the revenue decline of 11%. We also managed to reduce leverage from 5.9 times EBITDA by the end of last year to 5.8 times by the end of the first quarter. So in the remainder of 2025 we will continue to focus on implementing efficiencies and we're trying to grow full year EBITDA generate free cash flow and our priority is to keep reducing our leverage ratio. If you read Moody\u2019s report, unfortunately it appears that they are concerned with the slowing economic growth in the US for 2025. And this, as you read there, it's triggered by the potential implementation of tariffs and Mexico's relatively weak economic environment. And they have adopted a more cautious view with regard to our advertising business and as a result downgraded Televisa Univision's credit ratings. But I mean we see a better scenario than they do. But that's what I can tell you about the downgrade and Carlos can take your first question."},{"end_time":"1071020","segment_id":14,"speaker":"Carlos Phillips","start_time":"1009940","text":"Hi Carlos, in terms of your question about cash flow, this year we expect to deliver another year of positive cash flow. However, you have to consider that as Valim and the team have mentioned, we're going to have higher CapEx requirements compared to last year. And in terms of the use of the free cash flow, as we've mentioned in previous calls, our number one priority is to pay down debt. As you saw during the quarter we paid down our 2025 bond maturity which was around $219 million. As we mentioned in the past we had hedged that into peso exposure at a pretty attractive rate. It was 17.8 FX and we expect to continue doing the same. Our leverage fell from 2.5 to 2.4 this quarter and we want to continue strengthening our leverage position and also continuing to have a very conservative liquidity position. As we've mentioned before, the idea here is to maintain our investment grade ratings. We're very committed to."},{"end_time":"1075190","segment_id":15,"speaker":"Carlos Legaretta","start_time":"1074230","text":"Thank you both for your comments."},{"end_time":"1084710","segment_id":16,"speaker":"Operator","start_time":"1079430","text":"Our next question comes from Gustavo Farias with ubs.

If you ask me, you see competitors behaving rationally. There are not significant discounts in price. And in a mature market, if you try to add a lot of gross adds, you end up having a higher churn as well. So the way we approach this is we think this market, we need to grow between 350,000, 400,000 new gross adds per quarter and have a smaller number than that in terms of cancellations. So that's the way we see this moving forward. And that we have done obviously many things in terms of churn reduction and also how to acquire customers that are of better quality because they think that's the way moving forward. We have a very robust and reliable subscriber base and we are working very hard to maintain that subscriber base in the long run.

I will now turn the call over to Mr. Alfonso de Angotia, Co-Chief Executive Officer of Grupo Televisa. Please go ahead, sir. Thank you, Elsa. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. With me today are Francisco Valim, CEO of Cable and Sky, and Carlos Phillips, CFO of Grupo Televisa. Before discussing our first quarter operating and financial performance, let me remind you of the strategic priorities approved by the Board of Directors of Grupo Televisa and Televisa Univision that we will pursue this year.

Having said that, let me turn the call over to Valim as he will discuss the operating and financial performance of our consolidated assets. Thank you, Alfonso. Good morning everyone. First, let me walk you through the operating financial performance of our cable operations. We ended March with a network of 19.9 million homes after passing around 13,000 new homes during the quarter. In the first quarter, our monthly churn rate remained in line with our historical average of 2% as we kept executing on our strategy to focus on value customers rather than volume while working on customer retention and satisfaction. Our broadband gross adds improved considerably on a sequential basis, allowing us to deliver disconnections of only around 6,000 subscribers during the first quarter compared to a loss of 85,000 in the fourth quarter of last year. Regarding video, we also experienced stronger gross adds than in the fourth quarter of last year. Therefore, we lost about 73,000 video subscribers in the first quarter compared to the 95,000 disconnections in the fourth quarter of 2024. Of note, our mobile net adds were solid at 36,000 subscribers during the first quarter compared to a full year net adds of 26,000 in 2024. We were able to achieve this because late last year we relaunched a new and innovative MVNO service developed by ZTE, offering enhanced user experience. We are confident that this new service will make our bundles more competitive while allowing us to increase the share of wallet from our existing customers. During the quarter, net revenue from our residential operations of 10.5 billion pesos which accounted for around 91% of total cable revenue, decreased by 3% year-on-year, mainly because we lost some revenue given the cancellation of the Aficionados video package during the second quarter of 2020 and as we had a slightly lower subscriber base. Net revenue from our enterprise operations of 1 billion pesos, which are accounted for around 9% of total cable revenue, declined by 4.5% year-on-year. As in the first quarter 2024, we are concluding an important government contract which translated into higher revenue streams. Moving on to Sky's operating and financial performance, during the fourth quarter we lost 331,000 revenue generating units, mostly coming from prepaid subscribers that had not been recharging their services. Sky first quarter revenue of 2.5 billion pesos, fell by 13.2% year-on-year, mainly driven by a lower subscriber base. To sum up, Segment revenue of 15.1 billion pesos, fell by 5.7 year-on-year while operating segment income of 5.7 billion pesos declined by 3.1%. Our operating segment income margin of 37.8% expanded by 100 basis points year-on-year, mainly driven by the efficiency measures that we have been implementing and synergies from the ongoing integration between EC and Sky. On a sequential basis, our operating segment income for the first quarter already marked a turning point as IT increased by 1.6% quarter on quarter while our operating segment income margin expanded by 180 basis points. Regarding CapEx deployment, our total investment of 1.8 billion pesos during the first quarter fell by around 13% year-on-year. So our CAPEX to sales ratio of 11.8% was around 100 basis points lower than that of the first quarter of 2024. Finally, operating cash flow of cable and sky, which is equivalent to EBITDA minus CAPEX, was 3.9 billion pesos in the first quarter, increasing by 2% year-on-year and accounting for 26% of sales. This basically means that our operating cash flow margin increased by 200 basis points year-on-year. Thank you Balim. Now let me walk you through Televisa Univision's first quarter results released last week. The company's first quarter revenue of $1 billion declined by 11% year-on-year while adjusted EBITDA of 345 million dollars increased by 5% excluding the impact from the depreciation of the Mexican peso. Televisa Univision's first quarter revenue decreased by 6% year-on-year due to the absence of the prior year's broadcast of the super bowl in the US and the impact of the renewal cycle with key distribution partners in Mexico. On the other hand, adjusted EBITDA increased by 10% year-on-year reflecting margin expansion expansion driven by the operational optimization plan we implemented in December of last year and continued DTC profitability. Moving on to the details of our revenue performance during the quarter, consolidated advertising revenue decreased by 13% year-on-year or 3% excluding the Super Bowl in the US and the FX impact. In the US advertising revenue was 11% lower as growth in DTC advertising revenue was offset by linear softness and the absence of the prior year's broadcast of the Super Bowl. Excluding the Super Bowl, US advertising revenue declined by 6%. In Mexico, advertising revenue declined by 16% year-on-year driven by the depreciation of the Mexican peso. FX Neutral advertising revenue in Mexico increased by 1% reflecting private sector growth across both linear and etc and the strong performance of sports content including Ligue IMX and the Super Bowl. During the quarter, consolidated subscription and licensing revenue fell by 7% year-on-year but grew 1% excluding the FX impact and and the previously mentioned distribution renewal cycle in Mexico. In the U.S. subscription and licensing revenue increased by 5% driven by Vix's premium tier. In Mexico, subscription and licensing revenue fell by 36% mainly due to the distribution renewal cycle and the depreciation of the Mexican peso. FX neutral subscription and licensing revenue in Mexico decreased by 26%, partially supported by the subscription growth in Vix's premium tier. Turning to Vix, we delivered another quarter of solid growth and profitability and reinforced the strength of our DTC strategy, our advertising video on demand tier continued to scale with double digit growth in reach relative to last year. At the same time, our subscription video on demand tier also achieved double digit subscriber growth even after a recent price increase in the U.S. underscoring the value of our unique offering. All in all, BICS remains well positioned, delivering consistent performance across key metrics while reinforcing our leadership in Spanish language streaming. Finally, at the end of the first quarter, Televisa Univision's leverage ratio was 5.8 times EBITDA compared to 5.9 times by the end of 2024 due to a combination of free cash flow generation and EBITDA growth. Moving on, Let me remind you that on March 18th we used part of the free cash flow generated last year by Grupo Televisa to pay the remaining $219 million principal amount senior notes maturing this year. This payment was hedged at an exchange rate of 17.8 pesos per dollar. Moreover, at the end of the first quarter, Grupo Televisa's leverage ratio of 2.4 times EBITDA compared to 2.5 times by the end of 2024 due to our free cash flow generation of around 2.2 billion pesos, during the quarter. To wrap up, Bernardo and I are confident that our focus on value, customers, efficiencies and ongoing integration between EC and Sky at Grupo Televisa and further integration and operational optimization at Televisa Univision, now that our DTC business has gained scale and achieved profitability, will allow us to create greater value for our shareholders throughout this year.

To ask a question, you may press Star then one on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. If at any time your question has been addressed and you would like to withdraw your question, please press Star then two. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster.

Can you give us some color on how much more we could see in expansions coming from these ongoing efficiencies? That would be great. And the second one if you could give us some color on the guidance of 1 million home pass for fiber in 2025, how should this be curve, given the first quarter, is there a risk of downside revision following the low number of homes passed? And can you give us an update on your CapEx budget for the year? That's it from my side. Thank you. Thank you. Livia Balim, can you answer this question, please? Sure. Alphonso. Livia, I think that the first question is we are still finalizing some synergies with sky, but we have a constant effort on margin improvement.

Hi Carlos, in terms of your question about cash flow, this year we expect to deliver another year of positive cash flow. However, you have to consider that as Valim and the team have mentioned, we're going to have higher CapEx requirements compared to last year. And in terms of the use of the free cash flow, as we've mentioned in previous calls, our number one priority is to pay down debt. As you saw during the quarter we paid down our 2025 bond maturity which was around $219 million. As we mentioned in the past we had hedged that into peso exposure at a pretty attractive rate. It was 17.8 FX and we expect to continue doing the same. Our leverage fell from 2.5 to 2.4 this quarter and we want to continue strengthening our leverage position and also continuing to have a very conservative liquidity position. As we've mentioned before, the idea here is to maintain our investment grade ratings. We're very committed to. Thank you both for your comments. Our next question comes from Gustavo Farias with ubs. Please go ahead. Oh, hi everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Also two from my end. So the first one, we've seen some lower broadband and video disconnections. So I'd like to hear your thoughts on what to expect throughout the year and what are you seeing in terms of overall competition and price environment for broadband specifically. And the second one, if you could. Comment. Your thoughts around all the new regulation that's going on in Mexico, especially regarding maybe possible restrictions in foreign advertising, maybe impacts that if any, you foresee for Televisa, Univision, it could be very helpful. Thank you. Francisco will answer your first question and I'll take the second one. So Gustavo, the idea is here we think this is a mature market, a very rational market. If you ask me, you see competitors behaving rationally. There are not significant discounts in price. And in a mature market, if you try to add a lot of gross adds, you end up having a higher churn as well. So the way we approach this is we think this market, we need to grow between 350,000, 400,000 new gross adds per quarter and have a smaller number than that in terms of cancellations. So that's the way we see this moving forward. And that we have done obviously many things in terms of churn reduction and also how to acquire customers that are of better quality because they think that's the way moving forward. We have a very robust and reliable subscriber base and we are working very hard to maintain that subscriber base in the long run. And so the gross ads minus the churn is mostly driven by new acquisitions as opposed to the more longer term subscribers. So you should. That's the way we see this moving forward. And quarter after quarter, starting with the second quarter, if I may. And Gustavo, to your first question or second question? I'm sorry. We're still analyzing the proposed telecommunications reform. As far as we understand, it will be open for discussion with the industry players before being approved at the lower house. Once we have a clearer view on the proposal, we'll be in better shape to share with you our thoughts. Also, as we currently understand it, limitations on advertising in Mexico are related to foreign governments buying advertising on television and other media. We're in full agreement with that change. It doesn't represent anything material for us in Mexico. Thank you all. Thank you all. This concludes our question and answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Dan Goetia for any closing remarks. Thank you very much. Thank you for participating in the call. And we're here to answer any questions that you may have. So give us a call. Thank you very much. Bye. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.","transcript_id":"63b97dfb-df2a-4261-9e6b-3929ce62e888","type":"NON_LIVE"}],"updated_at":"2025-05-01T00:21:55Z"},{"audio":{"content_type":"audio/mpeg","quality":"192kbps","url":"https://cdn.kscope.io/ks-trsc-68820d0533aa710001abada2.mp3?key=0168e3f5-cb74-4278-8437-b3db550908bb"},"call_id":"68820d0533aa710001abada2","call_title":"Ducomm's Q2 revenue hits record despite aerospace headwinds, eyes strong defense growth","created_at":"2025-08-07T16:59:04.728836Z","description":"Q3 2025 Ducommun (DCO) Earnings Conference Call","duration":51,"end_time":"2025-08-07T17:53:01Z","exchange":"NYSE","figis":["BBG001S5QDZ0"],"headline":"Ducommon reports record Q2 revenue of $202.3 million, driven by 16% growth in defense, while commercial aerospace faces challenges; optimism for Q3 and Q4 guidance.","language":"en","name":"Ducommun","participants":[{"call_id":"68820d0533aa710001abada2","human_verified":false,"mentions":3,"name":"Suman Mokaji","organization":"Ducommun Inc.","participant_id":"990c6287-54ba-47d2-84e6-5a5db6ba15cd","role":"Senior Vice President Chief Financial Officer"},{"call_id":"68820d0533aa710001abada2","human_verified":false,"mentions":7,"name":"Steve Oswald","organization":"Ducommun Inc.","participant_id":"9d8ec21c-d41a-4d25-b613-4209a3026eb8","role":"Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer"},{"call_id":"68820d0533aa710001abada2","human_verified":false,"mentions":4,"name":"Noah Popenic","organization":"Goldman Sachs","participant_id":"22654233-de41-439d-bb07-9128e10c1d74","role":"Equity Analyst at Goldman Sachs"},{"call_id":"68820d0533aa710001abada2","human_verified":false,"mentions":3,"name":"Ken Herbert","organization":"RBC Capital Markets","participant_id":"fe5b85e9-cd2d-404a-b35f-510d7dbdd1b0","role":"Equity Analyst at RBC Capital Markets"},{"call_id":"68820d0533aa710001abada2","human_verified":false,"mentions":4,"name":"Mike Crawford","organization":"B.

Thanks everyone for joining us today for our second quarter conference call today and as usual, I'll give an update of the current situation at the company. Afterwards. Suma will review our financials in detail. Let me start off again on this quarterly call with Ducommun's Vision 2027 game plan for investors as we continue our third year of execution in 2025. Strategy and Vision were developed coming out of the COVID pandemic over the summer and fall of 2022, unanimously approved by the Common Board in November 2022, then presented the following month in New York to investors where we got excellent feedback. Since that time, the Commons management has been executing the strategy by increasing the revenue percentage of engineered product and aftermarket content which is at 23% this year up from 15% in 2022 consolidating our rooftop footprint in contract manufacturing, continuing our focused acquisition program, executing the offloading strategy with defense primes and high growth segments, driving value added pricing, expanding content on our key commercial aerospace platforms. All of us here, as well as my fellow board members continue to have a high level of conviction in the Vision 2027 strategy and financial goals and believe the market catalysts ahead present a unique value creation opportunity for shareholders. The Q2 2025 results show again the strategy initiatives are working with both gross and adjusted EBITDA margins for example at record levels. With more opportunities to come for Ducommun for Q2, I'm happy to report revenues reached a new quarterly record of 202.3 million or 2.7% over prior year, beating our prior record of 2.0 1.4 million in Q3 of last year and also making this our 17th consecutive quarter with year over year growth in revenue. We achieved this despite headwinds in commercial aerospace build rates, destocking at BA and SPR which was anticipated, and the continued strategic pruning of our non core industrial businesses the right thing to do the revenue performance was driven by continued strength in our defense business which grew 16% during the quarter and was our second consecutive quarter with double digit growth. The growth of defense was driven by very strong performance in our missile franchise which grew by 39% during the quarter, along with Ducommun's radar business much newer to Ducommun, up 46%. Now, the outlook for our defense business continues to look great. In addition to the highlights I just mentioned, the Apache blades, Tomahawk cables and the TOW missile case are scheduled to be back starting in the second half and into 2026 as we are nearing final approvals from RTX and BA. In addition and previously discussed, our team continues to build scale at other defense customers outside of rtx, which is and has been a long term goal. Northrop Grumman is a great example of this strategic effort. I also thought it was the right time with the recent Wall Street Journal article on missiles published on July 23rd to highlight Ducommun's missile franchise and how well it is positioned to benefit from the replenishment of depleted worldwide inventories mentioned in the article, along with in general very robust US and FMS order activity. For background, Ducommun is a supplier on over a dozen key missile platforms including Amaran, Mir, PAC3, SM2, SM3, SM6, Tomahawk and Tow amongst others. Missile business was up 39% in the second quarter and our missile backlog also increased 30% compared to the year ago. Excellent news. For greater context, Ducommun currently supports 18 missile programs with at least $750,000 of revenue in the last 12 months. Complementing our missile portfolio is our strong radar franchise which is up and coming, covering marquee programs such as the Spy 6 radar, the LATAMs radar which is part of the Patriot missile defense system, the TPY2 radar used on the Thaad missile defense system and the GATR radar used by the US Marine Corps and various other radar platforms. This combination of both missile and radar platforms positioned us well in the current environment and also aligns us with key defense priorities outlined in the US Defense budget, including the Golden Dome as well as NATO priorities. We are in active negotiations with the Defense prime right now for record levels of the SM3 as an example and view our missile and radar franchises a bedrock for growth now and the next few years ahead. Strong growth in our defense business more than offset lower revenue in our commercial aerospace business which declined 10% in the quarter. However, the outlook is promising for commercial aerospace as Boeing continues to perform at improved build rates and they get through the G stocking along with spr. I also want to add that everything we see out of Boeing commercial the last three or four months has been very encouraging both on the 737 and 787, our main platforms. We're optimistic that bill rates will be growing from 38 to 42 on the 737 Max soon as outlined by Boeing on recent calls. Gross margin also grew 2.5 million to 26.6% in Q2, matching the record gross margin percentage achieved in Q1, up 60 basis points year over year from 26%. As we continue to realize benefits from our growing engineered product portfolio with aftermarket strategic value pricing initiatives, restructuring actions and productivity improvements, we have ceased manufacturing operations in both our Monrovia, California and Berryville, Arkansas operations. We expect to see those savings be higher as the receiving plants ramp up later this year and more fully in 2026. For adjusted operating income margins in Q2 the team delivered 9.9% which is just below the prior year of 10.1%. Electronic Systems segment margin grew nicely in the quarter with a good mix of profitable business and improvements in productivity. Adjusted EBITDA hit another record in Q2, achieving 16% of revenue for the first time, up 2.4 million to 32.4 million. Fantastic. This is our third quarter with adjusted EBITDA above 30 million and represents an expansion of 80 basis points above prior year and continues the strong momentum we saw in 2024 as we work towards the 18% goal in our Vision 2027 plan. Two and a half years to go. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.82 a share in Q2 2025 versus $0.52 a share for Q2 2024 and with adjustments diluted EPS was a strong $0.88 a share compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $0.83 in the prior year quarter. The higher GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS during the quarter was driven by improved operating income as well as lower interest costs due to lower interest rates along with a lower outstanding debt balance. The company's consolidated backlog continues to be strong at 1.02 billion but did decrease 50 million year over year due to timing of awards. We are in active negotiations with customers on a number of meaningful opportunities and based on our current pipeline we expect a significant uptick in orders in the second half. The defense backlog was flat compared to the prior year quarter and is at 593 million but expected to ramp up in the back half of the year. The commercial aerospace backlog decreased by 47 million compared to the prior year quarter due to lower OEM production rates and destocking, which we fully expect to come back in December 2022. We set a target of generating 25% of our revenues from engineered products, which was 9% in 2017 and 15% in 2020-22. In 2024 we reported that our engineered product business drove 23% of our total revenue of up from 19% in 2023, positioning us well ahead of the curve in achieving our Vision 2027 goal of certainly pushing and we're certainly pushing for a lot more. We achieved this both through focused investment driving organic growth in those current businesses, as well as the BLR acquisition in Q2 2025. We have maintained this 23% mix and continue to work on both organic and inorganic opportunities to drive this higher. We have made tremendous progress to date and I'm proud of our team and strategic plan. As for the second half of 2025, we are positioned to benefit from the expected Boeing recovery in the second half along with continued momentum in defense for revenue guidance. After a somewhat flattish first half, we're expecting mid single digit growth in Q3 with low double digit growth and Q4. In addition, we believe tariffs will have limited and no material impact on our 2025 revenues, a good story for our investors. Also, I want to reiterate as well that Ducommen is a US manufacturer with US employees and 95% of our revenue is produced in the US. Our only other facility is based in Guaymas, Mexico and that production is less than 5% of our revenue and thankfully covered under the USMCA exempting us from tariffs. The other good news is the commons revenue into China is almost entirely one program for an Airbus supplier who is owned by the government constitute less than 2% of our revenue. We have not seen any impact at this point on tariffs for our revenue. On the supplier side, we do procure some parts from Europe and Asia, but it is manageable and so far the impact has been seen to be pretty de minimis. We will continue to monitor it as the situation evolves, but at this point we certainly don't see it as being something that's a material impact to the company. Now let me provide some color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector. We saw revenues of 117 million compared to 101 million in Q2 2024 growth was driven by significant activity in missile programs such as TOW and Amran as well as solid growth in military rotorcraft, on the Gator radar and on a classified program. We also ended the second quarter with a backlog of 593 million flat to prior year, representing 58% of Ducommens total backlog in our Commercial Aerospace operations. Second quarter revenue declined 10% year over year, 78 million, driven mainly by lower rates on Boeing platforms, commercial helicopters and in flight entertainment. As I mentioned earlier, we believe that finally a much better story is ahead for BA and MAX now that production is ramping up again and they're working through their overstocked inventory. The backlog within our commercial aerospace business was 404 million at the end of the second quarter, decrease in 47 million compared to prior year, driven by lower rates on Boeing platforms. We expect this to recover as production rates ramp up in late 2025 and 2026. Revenue in our industrial business declined by 23% to $8 million during Q2 as we continually strategically prune our non core business from the portfolio. This will benefit the company in the longer term as we transition that capacity to our core aerospace and defense platforms. With that, I'll have Suman review our financial results in detail."},{"end_time":"1721100","segment_id":4,"speaker":"Suman Mokaji","start_time":"1082270","text":"Suman thank you Steve. As a reminder, please see the company's 10Q&Q2 earnings release for a further description of information mentioned on today's call. As Steve discussed, our second quarter results reflected another record quarter of revenue with strong growth in our military end markets, especially in missiles and radar systems. We also saw record gross margins and record EBITDA margins during the quarter. We are nearing the end of our facility consolidation projects which will drive further synergies in late 2025 and into 2026 as we close out the recertification of the various product lines at the receiving facilities. As Steve highlighted earlier, we also made great progress in continuing to build up our engineered product portfolio with with those revenues now contributing 23% to our mix. These actions, along with our strategic pricing initiatives drove continued gross margin expansion in Q2 and is keeping us on pace to achieve our Vision 2027 goals. Now turning to our second quarter results, revenue for the second quarter of 2025 was $202.3 million versus 197 million for the second quarter of 2024. The year over year increase of 2.7% reflects strong growth in military and space of 16% driven by increase in missiles, radar, military rotorcraft and a classified program. This was partially offset by weakness in our commercial aerospace business, mainly driven by lower revenues on Boeing platforms and on select commercial rotorcraft platforms. As we complete our facility consolidation exercise, we posted total gross profit of 53.7 million or 26.6% of revenue for the quarter versus 51.2 million or 26% of revenue in the prior year period. We continue to provide adjusted gross margin as we had certain non GAAP cost of revenue items in the prior year period relating to inventory step up amortization on our acquisitions and restructuring charges. On an adjusted basis, our gross margins were 26.6% in Q2 2025 and in Q2 2024. We also continue to make progress on our supply chain and the working capital in our business. Through our proactive efforts including strategic buys and our inventory investments, we have been able to avoid any significant operational impacts on our business. We continue to work to improve the working capital turns in the business and improve our cash flow. I also want to add that we did not see any material impact from tariffs in the second quarter and as Steve mentioned, we do not anticipate any significant impact to our P and L at this time. We are a US manufacturing business with US employees and generate 95% of revenues from our domestic facilities. Our revenues are also largely to domestic customers with US revenues being in excess of 85%. In 2024, revenues to China were less than 3%, mostly one customer for Airbus and there has been no impact to those volumes or orders at this time due to the tariffs. Our supply chain is also largely domestic with less than 5% of our direct suppliers being foreign. Some of our domestic suppliers do source materials from outside the United States, but even that is a very manageable spend with China being a low single digit percentage. We expect to mitigate the impact of tariffs on our material spend through military duty free exemptions, alternate sourcing of materials from domestic suppliers, or by passing on the impact to our customers. Ducommun reported operating income for 2Q17.2 million, or 8.5% of revenue, compared to 13.9 million or 7.1% of revenue in the prior year period. Adjusted operating income was 20 million or 9.9% of revenue this quarter compared to 19.9 million or 10.1% of revenue in the comparable period last year. The Company reported net income for the second quarter of 2025 of 12.6 million or $0.82 per diluted share, compared to net income of 7.7 million or $0.52 per diluted share a year ago. On an adjusted basis, the Company reported net income of 13.4 million or $0.88 per diluted share compared to adjusted net income of 12.5 million or $0.83 in Q2 2024. The higher net income and adjusted net income during the quarter was driven by the higher operating income and adjusted operating income and lower interest expense. Now let me turn to our segment results. Our structural systems segment posted revenue of $92 million in the second quarter of 2025 versus $95.6 million last year. The year over year change reflected $6.2 million in lower revenues across our commercial aerospace business, mainly driven by lower revenues on Boeing platforms as well as lower revenue on select commercial rotor platforms. As we complete the transition of certain product lines under our facility consolidation initiative, the decline in commercial aerospace was partially offset by 2.7 million of higher revenues across our military and space applications, driven by strength in military rotorcraft platforms and selected missile programs. Structural systems operating income for the quarter was 9.5 million or 10.4% of revenue, compared to 10.6 million or 11% of revenue for the prior year quarter. Excluding restructuring charges and other adjustments in both years, the segment operating margin was 13% in Q2 2025 versus 15.4% in Q2 2024. The decline in margin was driven by an unfavorable sales mix in the quarter. Our electronic systems segment posted revenue of $110.2 million in the second quarter of 2025 versus $101.4 million in the prior year period. The year over year change reflected $13.8 million in higher revenues in military and space applications, driven by strong growth in missiles and radar systems, military fixed wing aircraft and unclassified program. The strong growth in defense was partially offset by lower revenues from commercial aerospace and a reduction in our industrial business as we chose to selectively prune non core work. We have been pruning our industrial business now for multiple quarters, maintaining only select customers that are accretive to our business. Electronic systems operating income for the second quarter was 21 million or 19% of revenue versus 16.8 million or 16.6% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding restructuring charges and other adjustments in both years, the segment operating margin was 19.4% in Q2 2025 versus 16.9% in Q2 2024. The year over year increase was driven by a favorable product mix and better leverage of fixed costs from higher revenue. Next, I would like to provide an update on our ongoing restructuring program. As a reminder and as discussed previously, we commenced a restructuring initiative back in 2022. These actions are being taken to better position the company for stronger performance in the short and long term. This includes the shutdown of our facilities in Monrovia, California and Berryville, Arkansas and the transfer of that work to our low cost operation in Guaymas, Mexico and to other existing performance centers in the United States. We continue to make progress on these transitions and are working diligently with with our customers Boeing and RTX to obtain the requisite approvals which are expected to be completed by the end of Q3 this quarter we expect it to start this quarter we expect to start full production of rotor blades for the Apache helicopter at our Coxsackie, New York facility which will complete the transition of that program from California. We are also working through the transition of 737 Max spoilers, Tomahawk harnesses and the DOEM missile cases which are all expected to go into production in Guaymas in the second half of this year. During Q2 2025 we recorded 0.6 million net in restructuring charges. We expect to incur an additional 0.5 to 1 million in restructuring expenses as we complete the program. As previously communicated, we expect to generate 11 to 13 million in annual savings from our actions and have already seen some realization of savings in 2024. In the first half of this year we expect the synergies to ramp UP in late 2025 and into 2026 as the product recertification is complete and the receiving facilities move up the learning curve and ramp up production. We anticipate selling the land and building in Monrovia and during the second quarter we closed on the sale of the Berryville facility, turning to liquidity and Capital Resources. In Q2 2025 we generated $22.4 million in cash flow from operating activities which was an improvement compared to 3.5 million in Q2 2024. The improvement was due to net income growth of 4.8 million as well as better working capital management. As of the end of the second quarter we had available liquidity of 236.9 million comprising of the unutilized portion of our revolver and cash on hand. Our existing credit facility was put in place in July 2022 at an opportune time in the credit market, allowing us to reduce our spread, increase the size of our revolver and allowing us the flexibility to execute on our acquisition strategy. Our strong cash generation allowed us to pay down the remaining balance on our revolver during Q2 2025 and the entire 200 million revolver capacity is now available to us. Interest expense in Q2 2025 was 3 million compared to 4 million in Q2 2024. The year over year improvement in interest cost was primarily due to lower interest rates along with a lower debt balance. In November 2021, we put in place an interest rate hedge that went into effect for a seven year period starting January 2024 and pegs the one month term so far at 170 basis points for $150 million of our debt. The hedge will continue to drive significant interest cost savings in 2025 and beyond. To conclude the financial review for Q2 2025, I would like to say that the second quarter results complete a strong first half, building on the momentum from 2024 and positions us well for the rest of 2025 and beyond. I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"},{"end_time":"1786630","segment_id":5,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"1721500","text":"Okay, thanks Suman. Just close before we get to questions here. You know, Q2 was an excellent continuation of our strategy working despite the anticipated headwind from commercial aerospace. As we've talked about, we achieved another quarter of record revenue and have a good step up forecasted in the second half of 2025. Adjusted EBITDA gross margins were also at record levels of 16% and 26.6% respectively in the quarter. We're in great shape to meet and exceed our Vision 2027 target of 25% plus of engineered product revenues with 2025 Q2 coming in at 23%. Finally, with commercial bill rates heading higher, getting past destocking along with stronger defense activity, especially in missiles and we believe radar as well. Very optimistic about what lies ahead in the second half and the next few years for our shareholders, for our employees and other stakeholders. So thank you for listening. Let's go to questions."},{"end_time":"1811180","segment_id":6,"speaker":"OPERATOR","start_time":"1788070","text":"Thank you.

To withdraw your question, please press star 11 again. Please stand by while I compile the Q and A roster. Our first question comes from Noah Popenic from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead."},{"end_time":"1813900","segment_id":7,"speaker":"Noah Popenic","start_time":"1813260","text":"Hey everyone."},{"end_time":"1815660","segment_id":8,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"1814940","text":"Hi Noah."},{"end_time":"1816620","segment_id":9,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"1815660","text":"Thanks for joining us."},{"end_time":"1850390","segment_id":10,"speaker":"Noah Popenic","start_time":"1818060","text":"Yeah, thanks Steve. The forecast for low double digit organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter, that would imply you expect the aerospace original equipment inventory destocking has ended by then. Do you, do you have that visibility? And then I guess, you know, as we move into 2026, can we use that exit rate as a, as a guidepost at least on the aerospace side, especially given how easy the comparisons will be?"},{"end_time":"1852950","segment_id":11,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"1852550","text":"No."},{"end_time":"1892240","segment_id":12,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"1853430","text":"Great question. And what, what we're seeing is certainly some ramp up activity in commercial aerospace as we go into Q3 and Q4. But even in our defense business, and Steve highlighted some of the great things that we're seeing in our missiles and radar business. We are expecting a higher level of activity on the defense side of our business and that's going to be a key driver. We're not expecting a huge ramp up in commercial aerospace. Huge here in these last two quarters. There'll be some. But it's really also going to come from the defense portion of our business, which looks strong."},{"end_time":"1929350","segment_id":13,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"1892240","text":"Yeah, no, we're, you know, we're obviously going to see better in commercial aerospace. That's what we believe. We don't have a great line of sight into destocking. We've tried. We still think there's going to be some of that. So we feel the double digit, low double digit in Q4 is going to be better on commercial, but it's going to be strong defense. And remember, you know, we have these products that have been offline like the Apache rotor blade which is coming online this quarter and that's going to help us in Q4. So we've got some, some upside there too."},{"end_time":"1960500","segment_id":14,"speaker":"Noah Popenic","start_time":"1930630","text":"Okay, that is interesting. And then Suman, can you spend another minute on the cash flow? That's one of the higher 2Q cash from Ops numbers you've ever had. But you still, I think you still actually had working capital as a headwind. What's driving the improvement? And can you get to that 50% of EBITDA conversion for the year or close to it?"},{"end_time":"2023440","segment_id":15,"speaker":"Suman Mokaji","start_time":"1962500","text":"So no, yes, we did have working capital as a headwind, but as a lesser headwind than we did in Q2 of last year. And this is one of the stronger cash flows we've had in the company's history. In Q2 we are looking at free cash flow conversion as well. And historically we look at 20, 24, it was 40%. Free cash flow is a percentage of adjusted net income this year. Year to date we are at 55% which is a noticeable improvement. I think taxes have also helped us with some of the changes in tax rules under the new act. It's certainly helping us. But even in terms of just operating performance and higher profits driving higher cash flows, we expect us to continue to improve that free cash flow conversion ratio to kind of our ultimate goal of getting to 100% free cash flow conversion over the next couple of years."},{"end_time":"2053820","segment_id":16,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"2023530","text":"Yeah. And Noah, just to get back to your earlier question, I don't want to leave it because I know this destocking thing is important for everybody on the call is that again, we've asked for things both from BA and Spirit. You know, we do the best we can with it. You know, we're still going to have some destocking through the rest of the year on certain things. We think that, you know, or we hope that, you know, probably first quarter, second quarter next year, we'll be clear. I'm just not sure. I really couldn't tell you, honestly, it'd be the end of this year. I wish it was, but just not sure at this point."},{"end_time":"2055570","segment_id":17,"speaker":"Noah Popenic","start_time":"2055170","text":"Okay."},{"end_time":"2057490","segment_id":18,"speaker":"Noah Popenic","start_time":"2056050","text":"Appreciate the detail.

Steve and Suman, nice results."},{"end_time":"2076810","segment_id":23,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"2073810","text":"Thank you. Ken, I just wanted to ask you."},{"end_time":"2100450","segment_id":24,"speaker":"Ken Herbert","start_time":"2076810","text":"You'Re still at sort of, I think it's 23% of the revenues from the engineered products portfolio. It sounds like that's not a maybe a significant mix tailwind in the second half of the year. What does the guidance imply for sort of exit rate from that portfolio this year into 2026? Maybe as a percent of the revenues?"},{"end_time":"2133090","segment_id":25,"speaker":"Suman Mokaji","start_time":"2102530","text":"It'll kind of depend on the acquisitions and what we close. I mean, I would expect us to kind of stay at a fairly steady rate here through the end of this year because even any acquisition will kind of come in at the tail end and may not, will not have a significant impact on the mix for the year. So I would expect it to be fairly consistent this year with the expectation that it continues to ramp up in 26."},{"end_time":"2142990","segment_id":26,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"2133090","text":"Yeah, I think that's about right. I think it's going to bounce around 23 can, but fairly close. And then obviously we're looking to ramp that up in 2026."},{"end_time":"2176230","segment_id":27,"speaker":"Ken Herbert","start_time":"2144030","text":"Yeah. So on that point, Steve or Simon, obviously it's been quite a while since you've announced an acquisition. A lot of your peers are talking about maybe a greater focus on acquisitions in the aerospace and defense sector. Can you comment on what you're seeing in the pipeline? Confidence of something maybe in the back half of the year and. And are you seeing more competition that may have pushed some opportunities out of reach? Any more detail on the M and."},{"end_time":"2177710","segment_id":28,"speaker":"Ken Herbert","start_time":"2176230","text":"A outlook would be helpful."},{"end_time":"2178230","segment_id":29,"speaker":"Ken Herbert","start_time":"2177710","text":"Thank you."},{"end_time":"2202190","segment_id":30,"speaker":"Suman Mokaji","start_time":"2179510","text":"We are continuing to see a number of opportunities, but there is increased level of competition. You're absolutely right. But we think we can be competitive enough to win assets. So we'll continue to keep our heads down and working on our pipeline and continue to work through the various opportunities we are seeing right now."},{"end_time":"2235290","segment_id":31,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"2202510","text":"Yeah, I think just if I jump in here, I think I like our pipeline right now for the second half. I think there's a few things out there that are interesting. You know, I'll say this from my old bosses. You know, we're picky eaters, as they say, as far as, you know, we do look at things and we're active and, you know, we're just, you know, we're just thoughtful. And I know that's what you want us to be as far as purchasing some of this. So we passed in the past and. But we have a couple of things that look promising in the second half."},{"end_time":"2237530","segment_id":32,"speaker":"Ken Herbert","start_time":"2236970","text":"That's great."},{"end_time":"2254160","segment_id":33,"speaker":"Ken Herbert","start_time":"2237530","text":"And if I could just finally any update on Monrovia and potential sale of that property and how we might think of that as ideally, you know, real estate values maybe firm up a little bit and you get a little better visibility there. Sounds like you were obviously successful on Berryville."},{"end_time":"2301100","segment_id":34,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"2254960","text":"Yeah. Well, let me just mention Berryville. I want to give credit to Saman and the entire team as well as Jerry Redondo. You know, we were able to get $2 million for that operation. And, you know, our expectations were quite a bit lower. So we're hoping that will continue. We did market Monroeville last year, but the bid we had, we felt that wasn't shareholder friendly and so we figured we'd pull back. So that's our next property. We're happy to have Berryville closed and sold. Hopefully some good things will be happening in the commercial market in the second half. But we are going to market it again. And we'll keep you posted. Great. Thanks, Steve. Thanks, Ken."},{"end_time":"2309420","segment_id":35,"speaker":"OPERATOR","start_time":"2303180","text":"Thank you.

Your business, I mean, 23% now it's near 200 million run rate. I mean, I know you're targeting, with this vision, 27, a billion dollars in revenue and 25%, that's 250 million. But would that be enough for that to be a standalone business or would it need more scale? And then I guess the answer to that is how difficult or not would it be to separate that from the rest of Ducommons business?"},{"end_time":"2343880","segment_id":38,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"2343400","text":"Yeah."},{"end_time":"2346920","segment_id":39,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"2344600","text":"Great question, Suman.

Let me say there is. There are unique attributes about the business which make engineered product businesses which make them attractive. Which is why we want to grow that as a mix of our overall revenues. That being said, you know, they are also, and they are managed fairly independently, but there are also synergies with the broader organization. Aerospace and defense is a small industry with the same set of customers that our engineered product businesses sell to as do the rest of our contract manufacturing business. So, you know, we're not necessarily viewing that as being a standalone business on its own, but certainly want it to be a larger portion of our portfolio."},{"end_time":"2416440","segment_id":44,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"2402640","text":"Yeah, we'll tell you this, Mike.

A little different category, but I know you've made some inroads into space and unmanned systems markets. I think you started with the Predator maybe a few years ago, but it hasn't been a huge part of your mix. You've had success, obviously with viasat and ifc, but any updates there?"},{"end_time":"2489430","segment_id":48,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"2446620","text":"You know, it's a bit of a tricky business for us just because there's a high level of expense, as you know, for developing these types of products. We are, you know, supporting space. You know, in Joplin we make, you know, cables, cabling, which is world class for space applications. You know, we do other things in our engineered products businesses. So we're, we're probably, as far as space goes, we're opportunistic. And that's what I would say. We're much more strategically aligned on defense and on commercial aerospace. But if there's a space application, which we can do, and it won't cost us a fortune and we'll have a good return, then we're happy to do it."},{"end_time":"2492630","segment_id":49,"speaker":"Mike Crawford","start_time":"2491350","text":"Okay, great.

I guess circling back to the destocking trends for a moment, it looks like commercial arrow might have actually been up sequentially this quarter, if I have it right. So I was just curious, obviously. I know you guys said there's not a ton of visibility into the back half of the year, but just sort of what kind of cadence you guys have seen so far. Did you see kind of do you think destocking has sort of picked up or where are you guys seeing that?"},{"end_time":"2534080","segment_id":53,"speaker":"Sam Strutziker","start_time":"2531280","text":"As of now, I would say, you."},{"end_time":"2547650","segment_id":54,"speaker":"Suman Mokaji","start_time":"2534080","text":"Know, destocking impact continues. There was we want to make sure our factories are operating at optimal capacity as well. So we've had some build ahead in commercial aerospace as well in our factories."},{"end_time":"2547890","segment_id":55,"speaker":"Suman Mokaji","start_time":"2547650","text":"Right."},{"end_time":"2566290","segment_id":56,"speaker":"Suman Mokaji","start_time":"2547890","text":"So that's kind of another form of destocking, I guess you could say. So as we do some build ahead, you will see some sequential improvement in commercial aerospace. But as far as destocking impact from Boeing and Spirit, I think that persists as much as it did in Q1."},{"end_time":"2607740","segment_id":57,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"2566290","text":"Yeah, yeah. See, Spirit, you know, you know, Boeing obviously is driving the train here, but Spirit is a major part of our MAX business. I mean, we do a lot for Spirit. And when Boeing had shut down and the strike and other things, Spirit, and rightfully so, didn't want to lay off 1,000 people. So they just kept making fuselages and there's a lot of fuselages still in the back and they're burning those down. So I think all good things ahead, but it's still an issue for the industry and for us at some level, but it's coming down. That's the best part about it, is progress is being made and that's what we want. Got it."},{"end_time":"2624380","segment_id":58,"speaker":"Sam Strutziker","start_time":"2608060","text":"Understood. Makes sense. And then I guess if I could just sneak in another one. Really nice, really nice margins in electronic systems. This quarter looks like it might be a high watermark. How should we think of that? As maybe a new floor or how sustainable are you guys thinking that might be?"},{"end_time":"2666440","segment_id":59,"speaker":"Suman Mokaji","start_time":"2626220","text":"I would say that if you look across the company, we probably had 50 basis points of favorability in margin due to favorable product mix. In the electronics business, it was more concentrated. The product mix favorability. On the flip side, on the structure side, it was unfavorable, which kind of net offsets to the 50 basis points I mentioned earlier. So I. I wouldn't say that the higher gross margins in the electronics are the new baseline. There's certainly a move in the right direction, but there was net favorability across the DCO portfolio of about 50 basis points."},{"end_time":"2668760","segment_id":60,"speaker":"Sam Strutziker","start_time":"2668200","text":"Got it."},{"end_time":"2669200","segment_id":61,"speaker":"Sam Strutziker","start_time":"2668760","text":"Okay."},{"end_time":"2684860","segment_id":62,"speaker":"Sam Strutziker","start_time":"2669200","text":"And then, sorry, just one last one. You guys mentioned, I think last quarter that Apache was going to maybe kick in this quarter. And just to clarify, I guess, was the uptick in rotorcraft a benefit from that Apache or is that still has not yet kicked in? We'll see that next quarter. I was just a little bit unclear."},{"end_time":"2703180","segment_id":63,"speaker":"Suman Mokaji","start_time":"2684860","text":"On the exact in Q2, Apache was still a headwind. In Q2, Apache was still a headwind as Coxacky, completes recertification on Apache. And there's been great progress here, even through the early part of Q3 here in getting that process completed, we're going to see a ramp up with Apache."},{"end_time":"2736280","segment_id":64,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"2703420","text":"Yeah, that's a good question.

You've done a great job growing this company. You know, you're almost a billion and a half size company. What's sort of the next leg over?

We'll have to, you know, just, I don't want to get too ahead of ourselves but you know, our goal is to continue to build this portfolio with higher, higher percentages of engineered product in the aftermarket as well as, as you know, Tony, we're continuing to take cost out and value price all our contract, you know, manufacturing, which is, which is a niche business.

We filed our Q2 2025 quarterly report on Form 10Q with the SEC today. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Oswald for a review of the operating results. Steve okay, thank you Simon. Thanks everyone for joining us today for our second quarter conference call today and as usual, I'll give an update of the current situation at the company. Afterwards. Suma will review our financials in detail. Let me start off again on this quarterly call with Ducommun's Vision 2027 game plan for investors as we continue our third year of execution in 2025. Strategy and Vision were developed coming out of the COVID pandemic over the summer and fall of 2022, unanimously approved by the Common Board in November 2022, then presented the following month in New York to investors where we got excellent feedback. Since that time, the Commons management has been executing the strategy by increasing the revenue percentage of engineered product and aftermarket content which is at 23% this year up from 15% in 2022 consolidating our rooftop footprint in contract manufacturing, continuing our focused acquisition program, executing the offloading strategy with defense primes and high growth segments, driving value added pricing, expanding content on our key commercial aerospace platforms. All of us here, as well as my fellow board members continue to have a high level of conviction in the Vision 2027 strategy and financial goals and believe the market catalysts ahead present a unique value creation opportunity for shareholders. The Q2 2025 results show again the strategy initiatives are working with both gross and adjusted EBITDA margins for example at record levels. With more opportunities to come for Ducommun for Q2, I'm happy to report revenues reached a new quarterly record of 202.3 million or 2.7% over prior year, beating our prior record of 2.0 1.4 million in Q3 of last year and also making this our 17th consecutive quarter with year over year growth in revenue. We achieved this despite headwinds in commercial aerospace build rates, destocking at BA and SPR which was anticipated, and the continued strategic pruning of our non core industrial businesses the right thing to do the revenue performance was driven by continued strength in our defense business which grew 16% during the quarter and was our second consecutive quarter with double digit growth. The growth of defense was driven by very strong performance in our missile franchise which grew by 39% during the quarter, along with Ducommun's radar business much newer to Ducommun, up 46%. Now, the outlook for our defense business continues to look great. In addition to the highlights I just mentioned, the Apache blades, Tomahawk cables and the TOW missile case are scheduled to be back starting in the second half and into 2026 as we are nearing final approvals from RTX and BA. In addition and previously discussed, our team continues to build scale at other defense customers outside of rtx, which is and has been a long term goal. Northrop Grumman is a great example of this strategic effort. I also thought it was the right time with the recent Wall Street Journal article on missiles published on July 23rd to highlight Ducommun's missile franchise and how well it is positioned to benefit from the replenishment of depleted worldwide inventories mentioned in the article, along with in general very robust US and FMS order activity. For background, Ducommun is a supplier on over a dozen key missile platforms including Amaran, Mir, PAC3, SM2, SM3, SM6, Tomahawk and Tow amongst others. Missile business was up 39% in the second quarter and our missile backlog also increased 30% compared to the year ago. Excellent news. For greater context, Ducommun currently supports 18 missile programs with at least $750,000 of revenue in the last 12 months. Complementing our missile portfolio is our strong radar franchise which is up and coming, covering marquee programs such as the Spy 6 radar, the LATAMs radar which is part of the Patriot missile defense system, the TPY2 radar used on the Thaad missile defense system and the GATR radar used by the US Marine Corps and various other radar platforms. This combination of both missile and radar platforms positioned us well in the current environment and also aligns us with key defense priorities outlined in the US Defense budget, including the Golden Dome as well as NATO priorities. We are in active negotiations with the Defense prime right now for record levels of the SM3 as an example and view our missile and radar franchises a bedrock for growth now and the next few years ahead. Strong growth in our defense business more than offset lower revenue in our commercial aerospace business which declined 10% in the quarter. However, the outlook is promising for commercial aerospace as Boeing continues to perform at improved build rates and they get through the G stocking along with spr. I also want to add that everything we see out of Boeing commercial the last three or four months has been very encouraging both on the 737 and 787, our main platforms. We're optimistic that bill rates will be growing from 38 to 42 on the 737 Max soon as outlined by Boeing on recent calls. Gross margin also grew 2.5 million to 26.6% in Q2, matching the record gross margin percentage achieved in Q1, up 60 basis points year over year from 26%. As we continue to realize benefits from our growing engineered product portfolio with aftermarket strategic value pricing initiatives, restructuring actions and productivity improvements, we have ceased manufacturing operations in both our Monrovia, California and Berryville, Arkansas operations. We expect to see those savings be higher as the receiving plants ramp up later this year and more fully in 2026. For adjusted operating income margins in Q2 the team delivered 9.9% which is just below the prior year of 10.1%. Electronic Systems segment margin grew nicely in the quarter with a good mix of profitable business and improvements in productivity. Adjusted EBITDA hit another record in Q2, achieving 16% of revenue for the first time, up 2.4 million to 32.4 million. Fantastic. This is our third quarter with adjusted EBITDA above 30 million and represents an expansion of 80 basis points above prior year and continues the strong momentum we saw in 2024 as we work towards the 18% goal in our Vision 2027 plan. Two and a half years to go. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.82 a share in Q2 2025 versus $0.52 a share for Q2 2024 and with adjustments diluted EPS was a strong $0.88 a share compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $0.83 in the prior year quarter. The higher GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS during the quarter was driven by improved operating income as well as lower interest costs due to lower interest rates along with a lower outstanding debt balance. The company's consolidated backlog continues to be strong at 1.02 billion but did decrease 50 million year over year due to timing of awards. We are in active negotiations with customers on a number of meaningful opportunities and based on our current pipeline we expect a significant uptick in orders in the second half. The defense backlog was flat compared to the prior year quarter and is at 593 million but expected to ramp up in the back half of the year. The commercial aerospace backlog decreased by 47 million compared to the prior year quarter due to lower OEM production rates and destocking, which we fully expect to come back in December 2022. We set a target of generating 25% of our revenues from engineered products, which was 9% in 2017 and 15% in 2020-22. In 2024 we reported that our engineered product business drove 23% of our total revenue of up from 19% in 2023, positioning us well ahead of the curve in achieving our Vision 2027 goal of certainly pushing and we're certainly pushing for a lot more. We achieved this both through focused investment driving organic growth in those current businesses, as well as the BLR acquisition in Q2 2025. We have maintained this 23% mix and continue to work on both organic and inorganic opportunities to drive this higher. We have made tremendous progress to date and I'm proud of our team and strategic plan. As for the second half of 2025, we are positioned to benefit from the expected Boeing recovery in the second half along with continued momentum in defense for revenue guidance. After a somewhat flattish first half, we're expecting mid single digit growth in Q3 with low double digit growth and Q4. In addition, we believe tariffs will have limited and no material impact on our 2025 revenues, a good story for our investors. Also, I want to reiterate as well that Ducommen is a US manufacturer with US employees and 95% of our revenue is produced in the US. Our only other facility is based in Guaymas, Mexico and that production is less than 5% of our revenue and thankfully covered under the USMCA exempting us from tariffs. The other good news is the commons revenue into China is almost entirely one program for an Airbus supplier who is owned by the government constitute less than 2% of our revenue. We have not seen any impact at this point on tariffs for our revenue. On the supplier side, we do procure some parts from Europe and Asia, but it is manageable and so far the impact has been seen to be pretty de minimis. We will continue to monitor it as the situation evolves, but at this point we certainly don't see it as being something that's a material impact to the company. Now let me provide some color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector. We saw revenues of 117 million compared to 101 million in Q2 2024 growth was driven by significant activity in missile programs such as TOW and Amran as well as solid growth in military rotorcraft, on the Gator radar and on a classified program. We also ended the second quarter with a backlog of 593 million flat to prior year, representing 58% of Ducommens total backlog in our Commercial Aerospace operations. Second quarter revenue declined 10% year over year, 78 million, driven mainly by lower rates on Boeing platforms, commercial helicopters and in flight entertainment. As I mentioned earlier, we believe that finally a much better story is ahead for BA and MAX now that production is ramping up again and they're working through their overstocked inventory. The backlog within our commercial aerospace business was 404 million at the end of the second quarter, decrease in 47 million compared to prior year, driven by lower rates on Boeing platforms. We expect this to recover as production rates ramp up in late 2025 and 2026. Revenue in our industrial business declined by 23% to $8 million during Q2 as we continually strategically prune our non core business from the portfolio. This will benefit the company in the longer term as we transition that capacity to our core aerospace and defense platforms. With that, I'll have Suman review our financial results in detail. Suman thank you Steve. As a reminder, please see the company's 10Q&Q2 earnings release for a further description of information mentioned on today's call. As Steve discussed, our second quarter results reflected another record quarter of revenue with strong growth in our military end markets, especially in missiles and radar systems. We also saw record gross margins and record EBITDA margins during the quarter. We are nearing the end of our facility consolidation projects which will drive further synergies in late 2025 and into 2026 as we close out the recertification of the various product lines at the receiving facilities. As Steve highlighted earlier, we also made great progress in continuing to build up our engineered product portfolio with with those revenues now contributing 23% to our mix. These actions, along with our strategic pricing initiatives drove continued gross margin expansion in Q2 and is keeping us on pace to achieve our Vision 2027 goals. Now turning to our second quarter results, revenue for the second quarter of 2025 was $202.3 million versus 197 million for the second quarter of 2024. The year over year increase of 2.7% reflects strong growth in military and space of 16% driven by increase in missiles, radar, military rotorcraft and a classified program. This was partially offset by weakness in our commercial aerospace business, mainly driven by lower revenues on Boeing platforms and on select commercial rotorcraft platforms. As we complete our facility consolidation exercise, we posted total gross profit of 53.7 million or 26.6% of revenue for the quarter versus 51.2 million or 26% of revenue in the prior year period. We continue to provide adjusted gross margin as we had certain non GAAP cost of revenue items in the prior year period relating to inventory step up amortization on our acquisitions and restructuring charges. On an adjusted basis, our gross margins were 26.6% in Q2 2025 and in Q2 2024. We also continue to make progress on our supply chain and the working capital in our business. Through our proactive efforts including strategic buys and our inventory investments, we have been able to avoid any significant operational impacts on our business. We continue to work to improve the working capital turns in the business and improve our cash flow. I also want to add that we did not see any material impact from tariffs in the second quarter and as Steve mentioned, we do not anticipate any significant impact to our P and L at this time. We are a US manufacturing business with US employees and generate 95% of revenues from our domestic facilities. Our revenues are also largely to domestic customers with US revenues being in excess of 85%. In 2024, revenues to China were less than 3%, mostly one customer for Airbus and there has been no impact to those volumes or orders at this time due to the tariffs. Our supply chain is also largely domestic with less than 5% of our direct suppliers being foreign. Some of our domestic suppliers do source materials from outside the United States, but even that is a very manageable spend with China being a low single digit percentage. We expect to mitigate the impact of tariffs on our material spend through military duty free exemptions, alternate sourcing of materials from domestic suppliers, or by passing on the impact to our customers. Ducommun reported operating income for 2Q17.2 million, or 8.5% of revenue, compared to 13.9 million or 7.1% of revenue in the prior year period. Adjusted operating income was 20 million or 9.9% of revenue this quarter compared to 19.9 million or 10.1% of revenue in the comparable period last year. The Company reported net income for the second quarter of 2025 of 12.6 million or $0.82 per diluted share, compared to net income of 7.7 million or $0.52 per diluted share a year ago. On an adjusted basis, the Company reported net income of 13.4 million or $0.88 per diluted share compared to adjusted net income of 12.5 million or $0.83 in Q2 2024. The higher net income and adjusted net income during the quarter was driven by the higher operating income and adjusted operating income and lower interest expense. Now let me turn to our segment results. Our structural systems segment posted revenue of $92 million in the second quarter of 2025 versus $95.6 million last year. The year over year change reflected $6.2 million in lower revenues across our commercial aerospace business, mainly driven by lower revenues on Boeing platforms as well as lower revenue on select commercial rotor platforms. As we complete the transition of certain product lines under our facility consolidation initiative, the decline in commercial aerospace was partially offset by 2.7 million of higher revenues across our military and space applications, driven by strength in military rotorcraft platforms and selected missile programs. Structural systems operating income for the quarter was 9.5 million or 10.4% of revenue, compared to 10.6 million or 11% of revenue for the prior year quarter. Excluding restructuring charges and other adjustments in both years, the segment operating margin was 13% in Q2 2025 versus 15.4% in Q2 2024. The decline in margin was driven by an unfavorable sales mix in the quarter. Our electronic systems segment posted revenue of $110.2 million in the second quarter of 2025 versus $101.4 million in the prior year period. The year over year change reflected $13.8 million in higher revenues in military and space applications, driven by strong growth in missiles and radar systems, military fixed wing aircraft and unclassified program. The strong growth in defense was partially offset by lower revenues from commercial aerospace and a reduction in our industrial business as we chose to selectively prune non core work. We have been pruning our industrial business now for multiple quarters, maintaining only select customers that are accretive to our business. Electronic systems operating income for the second quarter was 21 million or 19% of revenue versus 16.8 million or 16.6% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding restructuring charges and other adjustments in both years, the segment operating margin was 19.4% in Q2 2025 versus 16.9% in Q2 2024. The year over year increase was driven by a favorable product mix and better leverage of fixed costs from higher revenue. Next, I would like to provide an update on our ongoing restructuring program. As a reminder and as discussed previously, we commenced a restructuring initiative back in 2022. These actions are being taken to better position the company for stronger performance in the short and long term. This includes the shutdown of our facilities in Monrovia, California and Berryville, Arkansas and the transfer of that work to our low cost operation in Guaymas, Mexico and to other existing performance centers in the United States. We continue to make progress on these transitions and are working diligently with with our customers Boeing and RTX to obtain the requisite approvals which are expected to be completed by the end of Q3 this quarter we expect it to start this quarter we expect to start full production of rotor blades for the Apache helicopter at our Coxsackie, New York facility which will complete the transition of that program from California. We are also working through the transition of 737 Max spoilers, Tomahawk harnesses and the DOEM missile cases which are all expected to go into production in Guaymas in the second half of this year. During Q2 2025 we recorded 0.6 million net in restructuring charges. We expect to incur an additional 0.5 to 1 million in restructuring expenses as we complete the program. As previously communicated, we expect to generate 11 to 13 million in annual savings from our actions and have already seen some realization of savings in 2024. In the first half of this year we expect the synergies to ramp UP in late 2025 and into 2026 as the product recertification is complete and the receiving facilities move up the learning curve and ramp up production. We anticipate selling the land and building in Monrovia and during the second quarter we closed on the sale of the Berryville facility, turning to liquidity and Capital Resources. In Q2 2025 we generated $22.4 million in cash flow from operating activities which was an improvement compared to 3.5 million in Q2 2024. The improvement was due to net income growth of 4.8 million as well as better working capital management. As of the end of the second quarter we had available liquidity of 236.9 million comprising of the unutilized portion of our revolver and cash on hand. Our existing credit facility was put in place in July 2022 at an opportune time in the credit market, allowing us to reduce our spread, increase the size of our revolver and allowing us the flexibility to execute on our acquisition strategy. Our strong cash generation allowed us to pay down the remaining balance on our revolver during Q2 2025 and the entire 200 million revolver capacity is now available to us. Interest expense in Q2 2025 was 3 million compared to 4 million in Q2 2024. The year over year improvement in interest cost was primarily due to lower interest rates along with a lower debt balance. In November 2021, we put in place an interest rate hedge that went into effect for a seven year period starting January 2024 and pegs the one month term so far at 170 basis points for $150 million of our debt. The hedge will continue to drive significant interest cost savings in 2025 and beyond. To conclude the financial review for Q2 2025, I would like to say that the second quarter results complete a strong first half, building on the momentum from 2024 and positions us well for the rest of 2025 and beyond. I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve? Okay, thanks Suman. Just close before we get to questions here. You know, Q2 was an excellent continuation of our strategy working despite the anticipated headwind from commercial aerospace. As we've talked about, we achieved another quarter of record revenue and have a good step up forecasted in the second half of 2025. Adjusted EBITDA gross margins were also at record levels of 16% and 26.6% respectively in the quarter. We're in great shape to meet and exceed our Vision 2027 target of 25% plus of engineered product revenues with 2025 Q2 coming in at 23%. Finally, with commercial bill rates heading higher, getting past destocking along with stronger defense activity, especially in missiles and we believe radar as well. Very optimistic about what lies ahead in the second half and the next few years for our shareholders, for our employees and other stakeholders. So thank you for listening. Let's go to questions. Thank you. At this time we will conduct the question and answer session as a reminder to ask a question, you need to press Star 11 on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press star 11 again. Please stand by while I compile the Q and A roster. Our first question comes from Noah Popenic from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Hey everyone. Hi Noah. Thanks for joining us. Yeah, thanks Steve. The forecast for low double digit organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter, that would imply you expect the aerospace original equipment inventory destocking has ended by then. Do you, do you have that visibility? And then I guess, you know, as we move into 2026, can we use that exit rate as a, as a guidepost at least on the aerospace side, especially given how easy the comparisons will be? No. Great question. And what, what we're seeing is certainly some ramp up activity in commercial aerospace as we go into Q3 and Q4. But even in our defense business, and Steve highlighted some of the great things that we're seeing in our missiles and radar business. We are expecting a higher level of activity on the defense side of our business and that's going to be a key driver. We're not expecting a huge ramp up in commercial aerospace. Huge here in these last two quarters. There'll be some. But it's really also going to come from the defense portion of our business, which looks strong. Yeah, no, we're, you know, we're obviously going to see better in commercial aerospace. That's what we believe. We don't have a great line of sight into destocking. We've tried. We still think there's going to be some of that. So we feel the double digit, low double digit in Q4 is going to be better on commercial, but it's going to be strong defense. And remember, you know, we have these products that have been offline like the Apache rotor blade which is coming online this quarter and that's going to help us in Q4. So we've got some, some upside there too. Okay, that is interesting. And then Suman, can you spend another minute on the cash flow? That's one of the higher 2Q cash from Ops numbers you've ever had. But you still, I think you still actually had working capital as a headwind. What's driving the improvement? And can you get to that 50% of EBITDA conversion for the year or close to it? So no, yes, we did have working capital as a headwind, but as a lesser headwind than we did in Q2 of last year. And this is one of the stronger cash flows we've had in the company's history. In Q2 we are looking at free cash flow conversion as well. And historically we look at 20, 24, it was 40%. Free cash flow is a percentage of adjusted net income this year. Year to date we are at 55% which is a noticeable improvement. I think taxes have also helped us with some of the changes in tax rules under the new act. It's certainly helping us. But even in terms of just operating performance and higher profits driving higher cash flows, we expect us to continue to improve that free cash flow conversion ratio to kind of our ultimate goal of getting to 100% free cash flow conversion over the next couple of years. Yeah. And Noah, just to get back to your earlier question, I don't want to leave it because I know this destocking thing is important for everybody on the call is that again, we've asked for things both from BA and Spirit. You know, we do the best we can with it. You know, we're still going to have some destocking through the rest of the year on certain things. We think that, you know, or we hope that, you know, probably first quarter, second quarter next year, we'll be clear. I'm just not sure. I really couldn't tell you, honestly, it'd be the end of this year. I wish it was, but just not sure at this point. Okay. Appreciate the detail. Thank you. Okay, thanks. Appreciate you joining us. Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Herbert from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Yeah, hi. Thanks. Steve and Suman, nice results. Thank you. Ken, I just wanted to ask you. You'Re still at sort of, I think it's 23% of the revenues from the engineered products portfolio. It sounds like that's not a maybe a significant mix tailwind in the second half of the year. What does the guidance imply for sort of exit rate from that portfolio this year into 2026? Maybe as a percent of the revenues? It'll kind of depend on the acquisitions and what we close. I mean, I would expect us to kind of stay at a fairly steady rate here through the end of this year because even any acquisition will kind of come in at the tail end and may not, will not have a significant impact on the mix for the year. So I would expect it to be fairly consistent this year with the expectation that it continues to ramp up in 26. Yeah, I think that's about right. I think it's going to bounce around 23 can, but fairly close. And then obviously we're looking to ramp that up in 2026. Yeah. So on that point, Steve or Simon, obviously it's been quite a while since you've announced an acquisition. A lot of your peers are talking about maybe a greater focus on acquisitions in the aerospace and defense sector. Can you comment on what you're seeing in the pipeline? Confidence of something maybe in the back half of the year and. And are you seeing more competition that may have pushed some opportunities out of reach? Any more detail on the M and. A outlook would be helpful. Thank you. We are continuing to see a number of opportunities, but there is increased level of competition. You're absolutely right. But we think we can be competitive enough to win assets. So we'll continue to keep our heads down and working on our pipeline and continue to work through the various opportunities we are seeing right now. Yeah, I think just if I jump in here, I think I like our pipeline right now for the second half. I think there's a few things out there that are interesting. You know, I'll say this from my old bosses. You know, we're picky eaters, as they say, as far as, you know, we do look at things and we're active and, you know, we're just, you know, we're just thoughtful. And I know that's what you want us to be as far as purchasing some of this. So we passed in the past and. But we have a couple of things that look promising in the second half. That's great. And if I could just finally any update on Monrovia and potential sale of that property and how we might think of that as ideally, you know, real estate values maybe firm up a little bit and you get a little better visibility there. Sounds like you were obviously successful on Berryville. Yeah. Well, let me just mention Berryville. I want to give credit to Saman and the entire team as well as Jerry Redondo. You know, we were able to get $2 million for that operation. And, you know, our expectations were quite a bit lower. So we're hoping that will continue. We did market Monroeville last year, but the bid we had, we felt that wasn't shareholder friendly and so we figured we'd pull back. So that's our next property. We're happy to have Berryville closed and sold. Hopefully some good things will be happening in the commercial market in the second half. But we are going to market it again. And we'll keep you posted. Great. Thanks, Steve. Thanks, Ken. Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Crawford from B. Riley's Security. Please go ahead. Thanks. I'd like to get back to the engineered and aftermarket products mix. Your business, I mean, 23% now it's near 200 million run rate. I mean, I know you're targeting, with this vision, 27, a billion dollars in revenue and 25%, that's 250 million. But would that be enough for that to be a standalone business or would it need more scale? And then I guess the answer to that is how difficult or not would it be to separate that from the rest of Ducommons business? Yeah. Great question, Suman. You want to take that first? Yes. That business. Is. There are a lot of synergies between that business and our existing business. Let me say there is. There are unique attributes about the business which make engineered product businesses which make them attractive. Which is why we want to grow that as a mix of our overall revenues. That being said, you know, they are also, and they are managed fairly independently, but there are also synergies with the broader organization. Aerospace and defense is a small industry with the same set of customers that our engineered product businesses sell to as do the rest of our contract manufacturing business. So, you know, we're not necessarily viewing that as being a standalone business on its own, but certainly want it to be a larger portion of our portfolio. Yeah, we'll tell you this, Mike. It's a good question. Certainly scale in that area is our number one focus. So as far as having something stand alone in the future, I would just say stay tuned. We'll have to see. Okay, great. Thank you. And just one follow up question. A little different category, but I know you've made some inroads into space and unmanned systems markets. I think you started with the Predator maybe a few years ago, but it hasn't been a huge part of your mix. You've had success, obviously with viasat and ifc, but any updates there? You know, it's a bit of a tricky business for us just because there's a high level of expense, as you know, for developing these types of products. We are, you know, supporting space. You know, in Joplin we make, you know, cables, cabling, which is world class for space applications. You know, we do other things in our engineered products businesses. So we're, we're probably, as far as space goes, we're opportunistic. And that's what I would say. We're much more strategically aligned on defense and on commercial aerospace. But if there's a space application, which we can do, and it won't cost us a fortune and we'll have a good return, then we're happy to do it. Okay, great. Thanks, Steve. Thanks, Mike. Thank you. Our next question comes from Sam Strutziker from Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Hey, guys, I'm from Mike Chamola today. Thanks for taking the question. I guess circling back to the destocking trends for a moment, it looks like commercial arrow might have actually been up sequentially this quarter, if I have it right. So I was just curious, obviously. I know you guys said there's not a ton of visibility into the back half of the year, but just sort of what kind of cadence you guys have seen so far. Did you see kind of do you think destocking has sort of picked up or where are you guys seeing that? As of now, I would say, you. Know, destocking impact continues. There was we want to make sure our factories are operating at optimal capacity as well. So we've had some build ahead in commercial aerospace as well in our factories. Right. So that's kind of another form of destocking, I guess you could say. So as we do some build ahead, you will see some sequential improvement in commercial aerospace. But as far as destocking impact from Boeing and Spirit, I think that persists as much as it did in Q1. Yeah, yeah. See, Spirit, you know, you know, Boeing obviously is driving the train here, but Spirit is a major part of our MAX business. I mean, we do a lot for Spirit. And when Boeing had shut down and the strike and other things, Spirit, and rightfully so, didn't want to lay off 1,000 people. So they just kept making fuselages and there's a lot of fuselages still in the back and they're burning those down. So I think all good things ahead, but it's still an issue for the industry and for us at some level, but it's coming down. That's the best part about it, is progress is being made and that's what we want. Got it. Understood. Makes sense. And then I guess if I could just sneak in another one. Really nice, really nice margins in electronic systems. This quarter looks like it might be a high watermark. How should we think of that? As maybe a new floor or how sustainable are you guys thinking that might be? I would say that if you look across the company, we probably had 50 basis points of favorability in margin due to favorable product mix. In the electronics business, it was more concentrated. The product mix favorability. On the flip side, on the structure side, it was unfavorable, which kind of net offsets to the 50 basis points I mentioned earlier. So I. I wouldn't say that the higher gross margins in the electronics are the new baseline. There's certainly a move in the right direction, but there was net favorability across the DCO portfolio of about 50 basis points. Got it. Okay. And then, sorry, just one last one. You guys mentioned, I think last quarter that Apache was going to maybe kick in this quarter. And just to clarify, I guess, was the uptick in rotorcraft a benefit from that Apache or is that still has not yet kicked in? We'll see that next quarter. I was just a little bit unclear. On the exact in Q2, Apache was still a headwind. In Q2, Apache was still a headwind as Coxacky, completes recertification on Apache. And there's been great progress here, even through the early part of Q3 here in getting that process completed, we're going to see a ramp up with Apache. Yeah, that's a good question. We're all about sharing good news on this call. I got an update this morning from our New York team and Boeing was, and the military, everybody was at Kosaki the last two days and things could not have gone better. So it looks like, you know, sometime in August, later this month we'll be fully approved to start manufacturing and then we'll start shipping in September. So that's late breaking but wanted to share with everybody. Great, thanks guys. Thanks, Dan. Thank you. As a reminder to ask a question, you will need to press Star 11 on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Tony Bancroft from gemco Investors. Please go ahead. Well done on the quarter, gentlemen. Maybe backing up the 30,000ft. Back to the previous question with what you might do, potentially spinning off. I'm not sure what the direction of that question was but the aftermarket business could be self sufficient. You've done a great job growing this company. You know, you're almost a billion and a half size company. What's sort of the next leg over? I know you have the targets the next two years, but how do you envision this company? Maybe bigger picture, broader strokes over the next maybe five years. Great question. Headline is go, go, go. I mean pretty much, you know, we've got our vision 2027 at 25. We're going to, you know, we'll be out at some point with our vision, probably 2030. We'll have to, you know, just, I don't want to get too ahead of ourselves but you know, our goal is to continue to build this portfolio with higher, higher percentages of engineered product in the aftermarket as well as, as you know, Tony, we're continuing to take cost out and value price all our contract, you know, manufacturing, which is, which is a niche business. Right. It's a nice business. So you know, just, you're going to see more and more of that and you know, I think it's a ten year play. More and more and more. Thank you. That's how I see it. Tony, thanks for joining us. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I will now turn it back over to Steve Oswald for final remarks. Okay, thank you. Appreciate everyone calling in this morning listening. You know, obviously my remarks on my remarks, I feel very good about where we are. I think that there's a lot of tailwind. We are in great shape as I mentioned earlier on this missile franchise. You know, in the next couple years, our radar business is doing terrific. And, you know, I'm getting closer and closer to Boeing and their BCA team and spending some time with them and everything. I can see it's thumbs up and they're going to continue, I think, to do great things on the 37 and the 87. So I want to leave you with that. Thank you. Again, forward to connecting soon. Thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.","transcript_id":"92843d89-6f82-4607-8561-d803bf128140","type":"NON_LIVE"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-07T17:53:20.089482Z"},{"audio":{"content_type":"audio/mpeg","quality":"192kbps","url":"https://cdn.kscope.io/ks-trsc-668b0bd93fb4f948d3d88ad.mp3?key=0168e3f5-cb74-4278-8437-b3db550908bb"},"call_id":"668b0bd93fb4f948d3d88ad","call_title":"Ducommun reports Q1 growth as defense segment drives strong margins","created_at":"2025-05-06T16:59:02.748522Z","description":"","duration":63,"end_time":"2025-05-06T18:02:23Z","exchange":"NYSE","figis":["BBG001S5QDZ0"],"headline":"Ducommun achieves 1.7% revenue growth in Q1 2025, with record gross margins of 26.6% and strong defense demand, reaffirming mid-single digit growth outlook for the year.","language":"en","name":"Ducommun","participants":[{"call_id":"668b0bd93fb4f948d3d88ad","human_verified":false,"mentions":1,"name":"Suman","organization":"Ducommun","participant_id":"4c2be2b1-ddab-45b0-954b-7023230d1309","role":"Unknown"},{"call_id":"668b0bd93fb4f948d3d88ad","human_verified":false,"mentions":1,"name":"Steve","organization":"Ducommun","participant_id":"f8aaac54-73cc-4753-95bd-4a839506defc","role":"Unknown"},{"call_id":"668b0bd93fb4f948d3d88ad","human_verified":false,"mentions":1,"name":"Jamon","organization":"Ducommun","participant_id":"2af14719-b6b8-4139-a76e-748a2ccefd2e","role":"Unknown"},{"call_id":"668b0bd93fb4f948d3d88ad","human_verified":false,"mentions":1,"name":"Banks","organization":"Ducommun","participant_id":"7236368a-5123-41aa-8528-25c246154696","role":"Unknown"},{"call_id":"668b0bd93fb4f948d3d88ad","human_verified":false,"mentions":1,"name":"Sumani","organization":"Ducommun","participant_id":"da9863cd-7970-44bf-b472-1df4d34f44e0","role":"Unknown"},{"call_id":"668b0bd93fb4f948d3d88ad","human_verified":false,"mentions":1,"name":"Michael Chermoli","organization":"Ducommun","participant_id":"9c97aa05-2776-4c19-9f79-a443fc1efc90","role":"Equity Analyst at Truist Securities"},{"call_id":"668b0bd93fb4f948d3d88ad","human_verified":false,"mentions":2,"name":"Tony Bancroft","organization":"Ducommun","participant_id":"59b57b09-b939-482d-8a47-ef2bb1bee0c9","role":"Equity Analyst at Gamco Investors Inc."},{"call_id":"668b0bd93fb4f948d3d88ad","human_verified":false,"mentions":3,"name":"Noah Papanak","organization":"Ducommun","participant_id":"0d897baa-5057-42c4-a6e5-1b1499ab80fb","role":"Equity Analyst at Goldman Sachs"},{"call_id":"668b0bd93fb4f948d3d88ad","human_verified":false,"mentions":3,"name":"Jason Gursky","organization":"Ducommun","participant_id":"0dbf5a50-169d-4256-8012-e9dcdb1c0a38","role":"Equity Analyst at Citi"},{"call_id":"668b0bd93fb4f948d3d88ad","human_verified":false,"mentions":3,"name":"Ken Herbert","organization":"Ducommun","participant_id":"dea311a0-95e3-4687-b0f0-3be6174b18d7","role":"Equity Analyst at RBC Capital Markets"},{"call_id":"668b0bd93fb4f948d3d88ad","human_verified":false,"mentions":3,"name":"Mike Crawford","organization":"Ducommun","participant_id":"e82ccd5e-7435-4d35-b6e5-4f33dba169fd","role":"Equity Analyst at B.

The company achieved a record gross margin of 26.6%, driven by growth in its engineered products portfolio and strategic pricing initiatives. The defense sector saw a 15% revenue increase, offsetting a 10% decline in commercial aerospace revenue, while adjusted EBITDA reached 15.9% of sales.\n\n- The Vision 2027 strategy focuses on increasing the revenue from engineered products and aftermarket content, achieving a 23% contribution in 2024. The company is consolidating facilities and pursuing acquisitions, with ongoing restructuring expected to yield $11-13 million in annual savings. Ducommon aims for mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2025, expecting a strong second half driven by Boeing's recovery and defense program ramp-ups.\n\n- Management highlighted the resilience of their business model, balancing defense and commercial aerospace sectors to navigate market fluctuations. They reaffirmed confidence in achieving Vision 2027 targets, with strategic emphasis on engineered product growth and maintaining strong relationships with key defense and aerospace clients. The company is also exploring M&A opportunities to further enhance its engineered product mix, contributing to future margin expansion.","summary_id":"06ef19f9-cbce-4081-a45b-1c34f91664d3","symbol":"","transcript_id":"","updated_at":"2025-05-06T18:02:42.344607Z"},"symbol":"DCO","ticker":"DCO","transcripts":[{"language":"en-US","segments":[{"end_time":"124390","segment_id":0,"speaker":"","start_time":"120400","text":"Good day and thank you for standing by.

Thanks everyone for joining. Us today for our first quarter conference call today. And as usual, I have a give. An update of the current situation at the company. Afterwards. Tomorrow. Will review our financials in detail. Let me start off again on this. Quarterly call with the Commons Vision 2027 game plan for investors. As we start our third year in 2025. The strategy and vision were developed coming out of the Covid pandemic over. The summer and fall of 2022 unanimously approved. By the Common board in November 2022, then presented to investors. The following month in New York, where we got excellent feedback. Since that time, the comments management has been executing the Vision 2027. Strategy. This includes increasing the revenue percentage of engine. Engineered product and aftermarket content, which finished at 23%. For 2024, up from 19% in 2023. Consolidating our rooftop footprint and contract, Manu. Manufacturing. Continuing the targeted acquisition program. Executing our offloading strategy with defense primes and. Highgrowth segments of the defense budget. Driving valueadded pricing. And expanded content on key commercial aerospace platform. Platforms. All of us here, as well as my fellow board members, continue to have a high level of conviction. In division 2020. Seven strategy and financial goals. And believe the many catalysts ahead present unique value creation opportunity for shareholders. The q one. 2025. Results are another example. Of our strategy and initiatives working. Just look at the. Margin, expansion, performance, and much more to come this year and in 2020. Six. Despite the challenges discussed on our prior earning. Earnings call. I'm happy to report q one sales of 194.1. Million, which was 1.7% over prior year, making. This quarter, our 16th consecutive quarter with yearoveryear growth in revenue. Team achieved this despite the headwinds in commercial aero. Aerospace bill rates destocking at BA and spr. And the continued strategic pruning of our noncore indust. Industrial business. It was also our 7th consecutive quarter above. 190,000,000 in revenue, strong growth in our missile and elect. Electronic warfare, along with military helicopter programs, drove our. Military and space revenue to 15% growth over prior year. This includes not just order increases, but also major programs. I've been speaking about coming online. Such as the offload of the next. Generation jammer from rtx and amran. Our defense. Visit. Looks great with Apache blades coming back online in Q two. Tom hall cables along with the toll missile case in Q three. We can't wait. I also want to point out that three of our top five. Customers in q one were defense primes, and that is consistent. With all of 2024 as well. Our team continues. To build scale at other defense customers outside of RTX. Which is and has been a longterm goal north of Grom. Groma is a great example of the strategic effort. The strong growth in our defense business more than offset lower revenue in our commer. Commercial aerospace business, which declined 10% in the quarter and was anticip. Anticipated. This is the first commercial aerospace decline in the past. 15 quarters for DCO. We had tough comparison. Q one. As both Boeing and spiritual higher demand during this period. Last. Year. We have seen steady improvement in demand with both these customers. Over the course of Q one 2025. Tell me, out of the Boeing strike. In Q four of last year, and the outlook is promising. I also want to add that everything we are seeing at a Boeing commercial last few months has been very enc. Encouraging both on the 737 and seven eight seven, our main platform. Platforms. We were optimistic that bill rates will be. At 38 soon on the 737. Gross margin also grew 4.7 million to 26.6% in Q. One. A new quarterly record of 200 basis points year over. Year from 24.6%. As we continue to realize yearover. Yearoveryear benefits from our growing engineered products portfolio with aftermarket. Strategic value pricing initiatives, restructuring actions. And productivity improvements. We have ceased manufacturing. Operations both on Monrovia, California and Berryville, Arkansas. Facilities and are already seeing cost savings from this action. We expect to see these savings be higher as the receiving plants ramp up. Production later this year and fully in 2026. Stay. Tuned for adjusted operating income margins. In Q one, the team delivered 9.9%, which was a 90 basis point improvement compared to prior year of 9%. We continue to be pleased with the growth in our engineered products portfolio. And our structures business this quarter, which fully rec. Recovered from a one time expense in Q four, 2024. We did tell investors last quarter it was one time and kept our. Word adjusted, EBITDA continues to grow compared to last year at 15. .9% a record for us is the percentage of sales up three point. 5 million in almost 31 million. Fantastic progress. This is our second quarter with adjusted ebitda above 30. Million and represents an expansion of 150 basis points above prior year. And continues the strong momentum we saw in 2024 as we work. Towards the 18% goal in our Vision 2027 plan. Gap diluted EPS was sixty nine cents a share in Q one 2025. Versus forty six cents a share for Q one 2024 and. with the adjustments diluted eps was a strong eighty three cents a share comp Compared to adjusted diluted EPS of share in the prior year. Quarter. The higher GAAp and adjusted diluted eps during the. Quarter was driven by improved operating income as well as lower. Interest costs due to lower interest rates along with a lower outstanding. Debt bounce. The company's consolidated backlog continue. Continues to be strong at 1.5 billion, increasing 8 million year over. Year. The defense backlog increased over 50 million compared to. The prior year quarter. No surprise there, and is now. At 620,000,000. The commercial aerospace backlog, Dec. Decreased by 31 million compared to the prior year quarter due to lower OEM. Production rates, but fully expected to come back. In December 2022, we set a target of generating. 25% plus of our revenue from engineered products which was 9% In 2017 and 15% in 2022. In 2024, we reported that our engineer product business drove 23% of our. Total revenue, up from 19% in 2023 position. Positioning us well ahead of the curve in achieving our Vision 2027 goal. And certainly pushing for a lot more. We achieved this both through focus. Investment driving organic growth in our current businesses as well as. The BlR acquisition. In q one 2025. We. Have maintained this mix at 23%. And continued working on both. Organic and inorganic opportunities to drive this higher. We. Made tremendous progress to date, and I'm proud of our team and strategic. Plans. As for 2025 revenue, we are positioned. To benefit from the expected Boeing recovery in the second half, along with the. Fence, which includes three programs mentioned earlier coming back online in. Q two and q three. We are reaffirming our guide of midsing. Midsingit revenue growth for the year, with QTube being flattished through last year. Through the commercial aerospace, including destocking, but anticipate good. Strength in the second half of 2025. In addition, we also believe. Tariffs will have a limited, if any, impact on our 2025 revenues. A good story for our investors. I want to reiterate as well that too common is a US manufacturer with us employees. And 90% 95% of our revenues produced in the US. Are. All. The other facility is based in Grimes, Mexico. And that production is less than 5% of our revenue and, thankfully recovered. Under the usmca exempting us from tariffs. The other good news is the common sales into China, there's almost entire. Entirely one program for an Airbus supplier who is owned by the government. Constitute less than 3% of our revenues and we have not seen any. Impact at this point on tariffs for ourselves. On the. Supplier side. We do procure some parts from Europe and Asia, but it is manageable. And so far the impact has been pretty de minimis. We will continue to monitor it as the situation evolves, but at this point, We certainly don't see it as being something material to the company. To sum it up, to comment in a lot of ways is the new trade policy. With most us manufacturing operations. And uS employ. Employees. Now let me provide some additional. Color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with. Our military and space sector, we saw revenues of 114,000,000 compared. To 99 million in q one 2024 growth was driven. By missile programs such as the tow and Amaran electronic. Warfare and radar programs, including the NGJ Aegis comb. Combat system gator and on the f 16 of Blackhawk for fixed and. Rotary win platforms. These were partially offset by weakness on the. F 35 Patriot and the V 22. We also. Ended the first quarter with a backlog of 620,000,000, an increase of 50. 1 million year over year, representing 59% of the commons total. Backlog. Within our commercial app, aerospace operations. First quarter, revenue took a step backwards, declining 10% year over year in the quart. Quarter to 72 million, driven mainly by lower rates on the 730. Seven, max. Commercial helicopters and infight entertainment. Partially offset by growth on the a 327 eight. Seven. As I mentioned earlier, we believe that finally. A much better story is ahead for BA and the max. Now the production is. Ramping up again after the strike. We have seen demand pickup at both Boe. Boeing and spirit over the last few months. The back. Backlog within our commercial aerospace business was 411,000,000 at the end. Of the first quarter, decreasing 31 million compared to prior year, driven by. Boeing strike late last year and its impact on production rates. We expect this to recover as production rates ramp up in. 2025. Revenue in our industrial business declined. To 9 million during q one as we continue to strategically prove nonco. Noncore business from the portfolio. This will benefit the company. In the long term as we transition that capacity to our core. Aerosp. Aerospace and defense platforms. With that. I'll have suman review our financial results in detail. Thank you, Steve. As a reminder, please see the company's ten. Q and q one earnings release for a further description of information mentioned. On today's call. As Steve discussed, our first quarter results reflected another period of solid performance with strong growth in our military. End markets. We also continued to make good progress on our facility consolidation projects, which are nearing completion. And will drive fur. further synergies in late 2025 and into 2026 as we close out the recertification of the various product lines at the receiving Facilities over the next few months. As Steve highlighted earlier, We also made great progress in continuing to build up our engineered product. Portfolio. With those revenues now contributing 23% to our. Mix these actions along with our strategic pricing initiatives. drove continued margin expansion in q one and is keeping us on pace to Achieve our vision. 2027 goals now turning to our first. Quarter results revenue for the first quarter of 2025. Was 194.1 million versus 100. And 90.8 million for the first quarter of 2024. The yearoveryear increase of 1.7% reflects strong growth in. Military and space of 15%, driven by increases in electronic war. Warfare missiles and radar systems. This was partially offset by weak. Weakness in our commercial aerospace business, mainly driven by lower revenues. On the 77 Max, we posted total gross profit of 51. .6 million, or 26.6% of revenue for the quarter. Versus 46.9 million, or 24.6% of. Revenue in the prior year period. We continue to provide Adj. Adjusted gross margins as we had certain nongaap cost of sales. It. Items in the prior year period relating to inventory step up. Amortization on our acquisitions and restructuring charges. On an adjusted basis, our gross margins were 26.6%. In q one, 2025 versus 25% in q one. 2024. The improvement in gross margins was driven. By our growing engineered products portfolio, strategic Pri. Pricing initiatives, productivity improvements and restructuring. Savings across both our structural systems and electronic system se. Segments. We also continued to make progress on supply chain and lab. Labor through our proactive efforts, including strategic buys and our. Inventory investments, we have been able to avoid any significant impacts. Th. Thus far on our business. Going forward, we will continue to work. To improve the working capital trends in the business and improve our cash flow. I also want to add that we did not see any measurable impact. From tariffs in the first quarter, and as Steve mentioned, Do not anticipate any significant impact to RPNL. We are a. Us manufacturing business with us employees and generate. 95% of revenues from our domestic facilities. The other five. Percent comes from Mexico, and all that revenue is tariff free through the USMCA. Our sales are also largely due to domestic customers, with us sales being in excess of 85% in 2024. Sales to China were less than 3%. Mostly to one customer for Airbus, and there has been no impact. To those volumes or orders at this time due to the tariffs. Our supply chain is also largely domestic, with less than 5% of. Our direct suppliers being foreign. Some of our domestic suppli. Suppliers do source materials from outside the United States. But even that is a very. Manageable spend, with China being a low single digit percentage. We expect to mitigate the impact of tariffs on our material spend. Through military duty free exemptions, alternate sourcing of material. Materials from domestic suppliers or by passing on the impact to our customers. The economy reported operating income for the. First quarter of 16.6 million, or 8.5% of revenue. Compared to 12.6 million, or 6.6% of revenue in the prior. Year period. Adjusted operating income was 19.2 million. Or 9.9% of revenue this quarter compared to. 17.1 million, or 9% of revenue, in the comparable period last. Year. The company reported net income for the first quarter of. 2025 of 10.5 million or sixty nine cents per. Diluted share compared to net income of 6.8 million or. Forty six cents per diluted share a year ago. On an adjusted. Basis, the company reported net income of 12.6 million, or 83. Cents per diluted share compared to adjusted net income of 10.4 million. Or $0.70 in q one, 2024. The. Higher net income and adjusted net income during the quarter was driven by the higher operating. Income and adjusted operating income. Now let me turn to. Our segment results. Our structural systems segment post. Posted revenue of 84.4 million in the first quarter of 2025 vers. Versus 83.3 million last year. The yearoveryear increase, ref. Reflected 2.3 million of higher sales across our military and space. Applications, including Blackhawk and Tow commercial. Aerospace was down just 2%, driven primarily by. A decline in seven three seven max, and commercial helicopters. Structural systems. Operating income for the quarter was ten point. 4 million, or 12.3% of revenue, compared to two point. 9 million, or 3.4% of revenue for the prior year quarter. Excluding restructuring charges and other adjustments in both years. The segment operating margin was 14.9% in q one 2020. Five. Versus 7.8% in q one, 2024. In Q four, 2024, we had noted unfavorable program mix and onetime costs impacting the profitability of the segment. We had highlighted these as temporary. With an expected recovery in q one 2025. Our performance. Here in Q one 2025 validates those comments. As we saw a strong recovery in the margins of the structural. System segment. Our electronic system segment. Posted revenue of 109.7 million in the first quarter. Of 2025 versus 107.5. Million in the prior year period. Higher revenues from toe and Amram. Missiles, as well as from electronic warfare and radar programs. Were partially offset by lower revenues from f 35 in flight. To entertainment electronics, along with a reduction in our industrial business. As we chose to selectively prune noncore work, we. Have been pruning our industrial business now for multiple quarters, Mainta. Maintaining only flat customers that are accretive to our business. Electronic systems. Operating income for the first quarter was 18.1 million. Or 16.5% of revenue versus 19 million or. 17.6% of revenue in the prior year period, excluding. Restructuring charges and other adjustments in both years. The segment operating margin. Was 16.9% in Q one 2025 versus 18 point. 4% in q one 2024. The year over year decrease was primarily. Due to lower manufacturing volume and higher manufacturing costs, partially. Offset by favorable product mix in the quarter. Next, I would like to provide an update on our ongoing restructuring program. As a reminder, and as discussed previously, we commence. Commenced a restructuring initiative back in 2022. These actions are being. Taken to better position the company for stronger performance in the short and. Long term. This includes the shutdown of our facilities in Monrov. Monrovia, California, and verywill, Arkansas. And the transfer of that work to our. Lowcost operation in Guamas, Mexico and to other existing performance center. Centers in the United States. We continue to make progress on these transition. Transitions and are working diligently with our customers, Boeing and RTX. To obtain the requisite approvals, which are expected to be completed by the end of. Q three later this month, we expect to start full product. Production of rotor blades for the Apache helicopter at our Koxak. Koxaki New York facility, which will complete the transition of that program. From our Monrovia, California facility. We are also. Working through the transition of seven three seven, max. Spoilers Tomahawk. Harnesses and the dome missile case, which are all expected to go into production. In Guimas in the second half of this year. During Q one 2025, we recorded 0.4 million in net restructuring charges. We expect to incur an additional zero five to 1 million in restructuring expenses as we complete. The program as previously communicated. We expect to generate eleven to 13 million in annual savings from our actions and have already seen some realization of savings in 2020. Four and the first quarter of this year, we expect the synergies to ramp up. In late 2025 and into 2026 as the product recertification. Is complete and the receiving facilities move up the learning cur. Curve and ramp up production. We anticipate selling the land and. Building at both Monrovia, California and Varyville, Arkansas. During the quarter, we reclassified the Berryville Land building. Buildings and building improvements to assets held for sale and are making progress. Towards the sale of that property in Q two. Turning out to liquidity and capital resources in Q. One 2025, we generated 0.8 million in cash flow from operating. Activities, which was an improvement compared to use of one point. 6 million in q one, 2024. The improvement was due to net income. Growth of 3.7 million, offset by investments in working capital. As of the end of the first quarter, we had available liquidity of 221.7 million. Comprising of the unutilized portion of our revolver and cash on hand. Our existing credit fac. Facility was put in place in July 2022 at an opportune time in the. Current market, allowing us to reduce our spread, increase the size of. Our revolver and allowing us the flexibility to execute on our acquisition. Strategy. Interest expense in q one, 2025. Was 3.3 million, compared to 3.9 million in q. One of. 2024, the yearoveryear improvement in interest cost. Was primarily due to lower interest rate along with. A lower debt balance in November 2021. We put. In place an interest rate hedge that went into effect for a seven year period. Starting January 2024 and pegs the one month term. So for at 170 basis points, for 150,000,000 of our deb. Debt. The hedge will continue to drive significant interest savings in. 2025 and beyond. To conclude, the financial review. For q one. 2025. I would like to say that the first quarter results. Are a strong start to the year, building on the momentum from 2024. Positions us well for the rest of 2025 and beyond. I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve okay, thanks, Iman. In closing, Q one was an exc. Excellent start to the year despite the anticipated headwind from. Commercial aerospace. As mentioned several times, we. Achieved another record for gross margin percentage at. 26.6%. And just keep in mind, a few years ago, We had a run rate of roughly 20% for an entire year, and that was back. In 2022. So we've come a long way in two years. And could not be happy about that. Adjusted ebitda percentage was great. And a record as well, at 15.9% of sales. We're also very well positioned to exceed our vision 2020. Seven target, 25% plus of engineer product revenues. With 2021 2025 q one coming in at 23%. And we're getting this as high as possible as it is our number one strategic. Focus. Finally, with commercial bill rates heading higher in the second half, getting past destocking along with stronger defense activ. Activity. I'm very optimistic about what lies ahead in the next few years for DCO. Its shareholders and other stakeholders. Okay, let's go to questions, please. Thank you. Thank you. At this time, we will conduct the question and answer session as a. Reminder to ask a question, you will need to press star one one on your telephone and wait. For your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press star. One. One again. One moment while we compile the Q and a roster. Our first. Question comes from the line of Mike Crawford with B. Riley securities. Your line is now. Open. Thank you. Starting with commercial. Aerospace. We know that Boeing is incre. Increasing their monthly build rates. But. How would you characterize any delay and when your shipset rate. Rates to Boeing and spirit would increase if Boeing does get product. Production up to 38 a month. We are seeing. Rates. From Boeing in the low 20s. We're seeing rates from spirit. Ramp up to the mid to high 20s as we went through Q one. And into April. We have know publicly that Boeing is likely producing. In the low thirty s at the moment, so there is some destock. Destocking impact that we are seeing, but the. Rates continue to progress and go up over the last four. Months this year. And so we are very optimistic that. There will continue to be despite the destocking. Continued growth in the demand for us on. Both those platforms. The expectation is that Boeing is. Able to get to. Their rate of 38. By the end of this year. Yeah. Mike, this is Steve. I'm very confident where. They are. They had a great April, as you can see. From the announce. Announcements they made. March to April was really impressive, I think. Their efficiency and everything they're doing within pugeon sound has gotten a lot better. I think 38 in the cards, probably. Maybe by September. October. So we're going to see a lift. Okay. Thank you. And then just. Turning to rotary wing. You had some weakness. But you also had some, quote selected rotary link platforms with higher rates. I take it that's. Apache or Apache? Blades are coming on in Q two. So what was performing higher in q one. And how much of this would you attribute? To blr aerospace. As you rightly pointed, on the defense side of our business. Well, the weakness that you pointed out, we saw. On the commercial side. We have some transitions ongoing, with production moving. From Monrovia to Koksaki. And so some demand with the bell helicopter. Some issues. We work with materials on Sikors. Sikorski platforms, which drove temporary softness in the quarter. On commercial helicopter. But we are. Going to see the Apache production here ramp up, which. Should be really a positive in Q two and beyond. On the road. Roadcraft side for us. Yeah. Plus, Mike, we're on the Apache engine. With Max seal. So. They're going great. With the engine business there, so that's a part of that lift, but. We might have this and that with blades right now, but now we're just. Starting to get ramped up. We cut the blades. Boeing looked at them. Everything's looking. Great. We got everybody trained out in New York. So. We're hoping. Obviously, these are high energy parts. You got to be careful. But. We're hoping in may we're going to start really ramping up. And we got the orders. We just got to get the production in place. Okay. Thank you. I just end. With the DSo increase in q one. Is that anything structural or contractual that changed or should. We look for those psos to come back down. Thank you. It's a good point. So we did have just some seasonality in the sales. In q one. We had a slightly bigger march. We had. Some items that went out towards the end of the quarter that. Drove it. There isn't any structural change. It was just the seasonality one time kind of thing. During the quarter. All right. Thank you. Mike. Thanks. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line. Of ken herbert with rbc capital markets. Your line is now open. Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Steven suman. I wanted to ask first. On the MNA pipeline. You obviously have placeholder for MNA contribution. As we think about Vision 27. It's been quiet recently on the deal front. Are you still tracking towards the placeholder you've got in place for 27 from m? And a, and maybe can you give any more detail on how the pipel. Pipeline looks now and due diligence efforts. And maybe expect. Expectations for MNA this year. Ken, thank you for the question and good morning. To you as well. We continue to track multiple opportunities in our pipeline. And. We've got to be disciplined. And make sure. We execute on the right one. We see enough in the pipeline for us to feel. Fairly confident in being able to get a deal done this year. And I think that's what I would say. The deal. Volume is good. We just looked at something fairly hard and did a lot of. Put a lot of hours in on it and turned out it just wasn't for us. So. We're involved in diligence, as you asked, and we're looking forward to getting one. Sooner than later, Ken. Okay, that's helpful. And are you seeing more in aerospace or defense? Or combined or anything. Maybe we should just keep in mind. I would say the businesses that we look at. Tend to be kind of niche engineered product businesses, which. Often will span across some defense platforms as well as commercial aerospace. So there is a mix of both. It isn't necessarily skewed one way. Or the other. Yeah, I would say that's where I can. I'd say we. Usually have sort of a mix. It's usually never 100% one way or the other, so that's. Sort of what we're seeing and what we've seen. Okay, and. Just finally. You seem to be running ahead of your 27. Targets in terms of contribution from the engineered products. And if you do another deal. This year, I'm assuming. It would be very focused on the engineered products. How should we think about. Maybe the margin. Contribution from these engineered products. You talk obviously a lot about the sales. Contribution to maybe help us understand how impactful this could be, as you. Grow that mix. To the Ebitda. I mean, I can imagine it's been a big. Component of, obviously, just the margin improvement on the gross margins and. Ebitda. But any help you can give in framing that as we think moving forward. On the engineered products would be nice. Thank you. Great question, Ken. And these are. Significantly. Accretive to our margins. Right. These are. Engineered proprietary product businesses with access to the aftermark. Aftermarket. And in line with some of the other after. Aftermarket peers that you cover. Right margins are in line with those. So they tend to be accretive. They tend to provide also significant. Margin Runway for us to execute on post acquisition. And so. We believe that this. Is continue to be, as we do, additional acquisitions. A key drive. Driver of margin expansion for us into 2027. Yeah, Ken also. We have as far as the value we provide for these products. We have very good pricing power. So that's the other thing which is important for invest. Investors to know. Thanks. Great. Thanks, Steve. Thanks, Jamon. Thanks. Thank you. Our next. Question comes from the line of Michael chair. Molly with truest securities, your line. Is now open. Hey, morning, guys. Thanks for taking the. Questions. Really nice margins here. Maybe Steve versus. To kind of level set us and unpack, maybe. The revenue. Guidance for the rest of the year. Mid single digit growth defense. Obviously had a really strong quarter here. But the comps do get a bit tougher, and you're obviously going to have some of this recovery in commercial arrow, but maybe how are you thinking about the growth rates between commercial, aero and defense for the remainder of the year. Yeah. Let me jump in there first. I think first thing might. Just to note. This is a real benefit for shareholders. That we have this mix of defense and commercial. Right. We've had a lot. Of peer groups or peers that have more commercial and they're struggling. A bit, but. As you can see, our defense business, we've been. Talking about really came. To the fore, as they say in. Q one. So first of all, we're really pleased with our balance. As far as what I can see. Obviously, we're flattish in Q two, but we feel very good. About destocking and commercial rates going up, not only. On the 37, but on the 87, right. Because we have a very good. Content mix there. So very positive on the back half. And I think. Maybe defense going forward, maybe not. 15. But certainly. A very respectable growth number. I don't think I'd add that as Steve is that we're going. To. See the ramp up in the programs that have been transitioning. Right? So. We have the. Toe missile cases. The. Spoilers and the Tomahawk program. So across commercial and defense, we're going. To get some lift in the back half from those programs coming back online. Which is going to be great for everyone. Okay, got it. What about the a 220? I know Airbus. 's commentary around both the 220 and 350 have been. A little bit squishy just given the spirit facilities. Do you expect that to be a material contributor to the a 220 this year? Look. Yeah. So a couple of things. First, that a 220 program has been great for. Us as we talked about. We make the fuselage sk. Skins. We're a supplier into China. We haven't seen any. Headwind yet, so we feel very. Good about that, so. That's going to continue. We feel as far as where we sit here today, it's going to again be good. Business this year lead. Leading to next year. I understand about the spirit issue and the engine issue. And I'm hoping sooner or later they're going to work through that, but we're running rate. Rates higher than what they're shipping, that's for sure. And we're happy. About that. The other thing is on the a 350. We're not a player on the a 350, so I know they're struggling it. Won't impact us. Got it. And last one for me. I could get called now the inflight entertainment side of commercial as being. Weak. I was just wondering if you could potentially size that business. What are the thoughts there? Just given. That's maybe viewed as more discretionary spending from the airlines. Does that continue to be a headwind? For the remainder of the year or. Was that just kind of short term here? Temporary? It's not a huge portion of. Our business. It's low. Single digit. Percentage of our total business. I think we'll continue to see some softness there. Through the rest of this year. That we expect will be offset. By other things in the portfolio. Mike del that's, I think the compares get a little bit. Easier. We had a really good Q one 2024. With inflight. You know what I mean? It's one customer. And obviously, we didn't have a great rest of the year with things kind of tamped out. A bit, so I think going forward we'll probably moderate around that. On a fair basis. Okay, perfect. Thanks, guys. I'll jump back in the queue. Goodbye. See you. This week. Thank you. Our next question comes. From the line of Jason Gersky with city. Your line is now open. Hey. Good morning, everybody. Steve. I wonder if you could just spend a few minutes. Talking about? The. Potential for. New work scopes. For you all. And maybe. Start with the commercial side. Obviously. Spirit aerosystems is going through a thing here. And I'm just wondering if there won't be some more opportunities. There for you as those assets land in different hands. So is there opportunity here? Either a Boeing or Airbus as a result of what's going on. At spirit aerosystems for you guys. That'd be the first part. Yeah, and then the second part would be on the defense. I'm just kind of curious. If. You are beginning to see any signs. Of increased. Outsourcing. Initiatives. By any of the big. Cap defense companies. Thanks. Okay. Thanks. Certainly. It's funny. You asked that. We have our senior VP out at Spirit actually, today meeting with them in Wichitas. So we have very close relationship with spirit. They're obviously a top customer of ours, and we do see more opportunity, especially as things ramp up. Okay, so, for instance. We just got going. On the 737 Max skins. And that's early on. Right. So we do four or five skins and we do. 15 a month. That's the deal we have. Right? So it's not paid by. The drink. And we feel very good about increasing business. There. We understand. There's delivery challenges. We're pretty much 100% on time. We're pretty close to both Airbus and spirit and. Boeing. So our operations are very strong. So we think. There is growth there. We're continuing to work. With them. I think the skins is sort of in the lead. As well. As maybe some other things that, as well as Airbus, we're getting quoted heavily by. Airbus, frankly, because some of the other suppliers are not getting the job done. Whether that changes hands, we'll have to see. But we see a lot of growth activity. As far as quoting. At this point. I think a good story. I think if you look at our just percentage of what we have, On the programs in general. And our operation perform. Performance. It's all very positive. You want to hang on the second part? On the defense side, I think we are continuing to see numerous. Opportunities to bid for work. Rtx. Is a big customer for us. Our biggest customer. And. We are actively bidding both a lot of new work with. Them. So I think stay tuned for additional. Wins for us there on the defense side as well. Yeah. The other, I'd say as well, Jason, is that look especially like on card businesses. Ccas, those type of things. On very difficult application. Applications. I mean, we're really good, right? So we picked. Up a lot from RTX that used to make these cards in Massachusetts. And now that's coming our way in Tulsa, and we have other. Things we're working on with Northrop. So. That's not changing. And I've been bullish on defense. I've been telling investors. Look. These things take time. And they do, because when you're moving something from an internal. Operation. At RTX to Tulsa. They're not going to give you everything at first. You got to get 50%, you got to get testing machines. So all. This is going to come together for us. I believe in this year, next year. So I was very happy with the 15%, I'll say that. In defense this war. Yeah, good to know. All right, thanks, guys. Thanks. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tony Bancroft with Gamco Investors, Inc. Your line? Is now open. Hey. Good morning, Jen. Congratulations. Well done. Based on the $1 trillion pbr. We sort of talked about this a little bit. And then on top of that, as sort of a two pronged attack here. Then. The increase in european defense spending. Maybe you could talk a little bit more in detail about how you see yourselves seeing positions for that growth trajectory. And maybe a little further out. There have been questions of being able to continue that growth. How do you see this? Maybe playing out over the next few years. And what programs? That you're on that are going to have the best exposure to the thrill. Yeah, Tony, I'll jump in, and then you can. I think first. And good afternoon. I think just in general. Our whole portfolio around. Electronic warfare. Missiles radar, obviously. Things are going to be happening with the golden Dome and some other things. We're still trying to figure. Out. We really feel very. Good and strong about. Being a part of. This. Trillion dollar budget. Being able to support all these. Customers. I mentioned in my remarks that. We've in. The past, right or wrongly. We were a big Raytheon house, as they would say. And now we're moving in much more to Northrop. We're moving into. BAE Systems. We're moving into some of these other companies. On purpose, right, to kind of build out this customer base. And we got a lot of things to provide. Cabling. We're great at that. We're great at. Cards. So we think that. We're. In the right position. And as I mentioned, Earlier. Not only the budget, but also. Customers like RTX are offloading, right? They're off. Offloading. They're driving margins. They might be three or four year into a program. With seven year fixed pricing and they have nowhere to go, so. They're going to move stuff out and they're going to try to drive margins. That way as a company. So it's all looking good, Tony. Nice job positioning yourself. Reach out, Steve. Thanks. Thanks very much. Good to hear from you. Thank you. As a reminder to ask a question, you will need to press star one one on your telephone. Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poppinc with Goldman Sachs. Your line is. Now open. Hey, guys. Hi, Doc. Good afternoon. Just kind of thinking through the pace. Of growth through the rest of the year, I think. You. Had last quarter talked about one q being flat, two q a little better. The one q actual is a little better. Still feel the same. About two. Q or is that looking better? And I guess. The defense growth rate is quite high in the quarter, as others have. Noted the compares get a little tougher there through the rest of the year, but not that much. Tougher. And Arrow is just down a ton in the first quarter. And Boeing was on strike and had things turned. Off, or I guess, was coming out of the strike, so I don't know. Maybe I'm splitting hairs on the mid single for the full year. But it's a little tough to get there. I guess if things break. The right way. Maybe it's just early in the year and it's a dynamic. Macro and you're being conservative. But how do you see the growth rate? Playing out through the year. And what's the. Upside of where things could land. Hello? No. Good afternoon. So, great question on the commercial aero. Aerospace side, I would say that. So if you look at Boeing and Airbus, they're about 50. Percent of our total commercial aerospace business. So we do expect. That to ramp up in the second half of the year, but I wouldn't apply that. Grow. Growth rate on our entire commercial aerospace revenue. Right? So 50%. And the other 50? Percent includes business jets and rotorcraft and other things. But there will be growth there. There will be continued strength in the defense business, as Steve mentioned earlier, may not. Be at the 15% mark, but we do expect. Based on? The programs and the visibility we have. For the rest of the year. There's going to be continued strength there. And then we have also. The ramp up on the programs that have moved from. One facility to another. And are currently kind of in hibernation. But are expected to ramp up in the second half of the year. They include. Toe missile case. They include spoilers in the seven three seven. Max as well as the Tomahawk harnesses. Along with the. Apache blade. So those are all expected to give us some lift in the second half. So we see good growth in commercial aerospace, good growth in defense. To kind of get us to that mid single digit number for the full year. Yeah, no, I'd. Also say, look. Okay. Is it a little. Conservative right now. Yes. We want to really see how the second quarter goes with. Ba and spirit. Obviously, that's a big part of our growth. Story. So. We'll probably have a firmer number. We will. In our next call, but that's kind of where we see it right now. Okay. That makes sense. Where do you expect your mix of revenue from engineered systems to be as. You're exiting the year. It will kind of depend on the acquisition. I think. If we do get an acquisition, it's likely to exceed. Or get very close to kind of the 25%. Again, depends on the timing also of the acquisition and how much your reven. Revenues are contributed, but we expect it to be in that. 23% to 24% likely this year, and with an acquisition. Ramping up to beyond 25%. In the next. Twelve months. Yeah, I think that's right, I think. We're obviously. Job one right now is another acquisition. Right? So. Everybody's working hard on that. So once we do that, we think we'll be over that and then. Come next year, we'll have new thoughts about. The next five years, right? So what we're holding right now with division 2027, and we're happy. Where we are. Okay. Should we expect the first quarter segment operating margin? To be the low watermark for the year, and you work higher sequentially. Off of it or. Is there seasonality? Or expense, timing or mix. That could drive a lower. Quarter at some point in year. I would say. There is some goodness in the Q one margin, so. At 15.9% ebitda margin, and if you linearly. Space out. Our Vision 2027 goal. We would kind of be at 16% by the end of the year. So we kind of are there already in Q. One. But it does have 50 to 75 basis points of, I would say. Mixed goodness in it. So. We'll continue to see, I think, good margins. For the rest of the year, but I wouldn't say this is a low water mark. But. With that 50 to 75 basis. Points range, I think. Is how I would say. Route 16 should be good, right? To the end. Of the year. Makes sense and then just. Last one. Suman. What are you expecting? For full year 2025. Free cash conversion, whether from your adjusted. Net income or Ebitda. We had 40% free cash flow conversion last year. In 2024, we had a little over 30% free cash flow conversion. In 2023. We expect 2025 to. Be continuing that path of improvement. I wouldn't. Guide to a specific number for the year. We don't typically provide free cash flow. Guidance. Our end goal here over the next few years is to get back to. 100% free cash flow as a percentage of adjusted net income, but. That will happen over the next couple of years as we un. Unwind our working capital investments. That would be better this year. But it will be better this year than it was continuing that, continuing that traject. Trajectory, definitely. Okay. Thank you so much. Thanks, Noah. Thanks for joining us. Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back. To Steve OSW. Oswald for closing remarks. Okay. Just wrapping up here. Thank you again. For joining us for the call. Again. Just to reiterate, we feel great about our start this year. We appreciate the thoughtful questions. The support from. Our shareholders. I feel very optimistic about. This year and next year, and we look forward to reconnect. Reconnecting after Q two. Have a very good day and a safe day. Thank you. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program.

Today as usual, I will give an update of the current situation at the company. Afterwards, Simone will review our financials in detail. Let me start off again on this quarterly call with Ducommun's Vision 2027 game plan for investors as we start our third year in 2025. The strategy and vision were developed coming out of the COVID pandemic over the summer and fall of 2022, unanimously approved by the Common Board in November 2022, then presented to investors the following month in New York where we got excellent feedback. Since that time the Commons management has been executing the Vision 2027 strategy. This includes increasing the revenue percentage of engineered product and aftermarket content which finished at 23% for 2024 up from 19% in 2023 consolidating our rooftop footprint and contract manufacturing continuing the targeted acquisition program executing our offloading strategy with defense primes and high growth segments of the defense budget, driving value added pricing and expanded content on key commercial aerospace platforms. All of us here as well as my fellow board members continue to have a high level of conviction in the Vision 2027 strategy and financial goals and believe the many catalysts ahead present unique value creation opportunity for shareholders. The Q1 2025 results are another example of our strategy and initiatives working. Just look at the margin expansion, performance and much more to come this year and in 2026. Despite the challenges discussed on our prior earnings call, I'm happy to report Q1 sales of 1.94.1 million which was 1.7% over prior year, making this quarter our 16th consecutive quarter with year over year growth in revenue team achieved this despite the headwinds in commercial aerospace bill rates, destocking at Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems and the continued strategic pruning of our non core industrial business. It was also our seventh consecutive quarter above $190 million in revenue. Strong growth in our missile and electronic warfare along with military helicopter programs drove our military and space revenue to 15% growth over prior year. This includes not just order increases but also major programs I've been speaking about coming online, such as the offload of the next generation Jammer from RTX and Amran. Our defense business looks great with Apache blades coming back online in Q2. Tom wild cables along with the tow missile case in Q3. We can't wait. I also want to point out that three of our top five customers in Q1 were defense primes and that is consistent with all of 2024 as well. Our team continues to build scale at other defense customers outside of RTX which is and has been a long term goal. Northrop Grumman is a great example of this strategic effort. The strong growth in our defense business more than offset lower revenue in our commercial aerospace business which declined 10% in the quarter and was anticipated. This is the first commercial aerospace decline in the past 15 quarters for DCO. We had tough compares in Q1 as both Boeing and Spirit drove higher demand during this period last year. We have seen steady improvement in demand with both these customers over the course of Q1 2025 coming out of the Boeing strike in Q4 2024 of last year and the outlook is promising. I also want to add that everything we are seeing out of Boeing commercial last few months has been very encouraging Both on the 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner our main platforms. We are optimistic that bill rates will be at 38 soon on the 737 Max. Gross margin also grew $4.7 million to 26.6% in Q1, which is a new quarterly record of 200 basis points year over year from 24.6% as we continue to realize year over year benefits from our growing engineered products portfolio with aftermarket strategic value pricing initiatives, restructuring actions and productivity improvements. We have ceased manufacturing operations both on Monrovia, California and and Berryville, Arkansas facilities and are already seeing cost savings from this action. We expect to see these savings be higher as the receiving plants ramp up production later this year and fully in 2026. Stay tuned for adjusted operating income margins. In Q1 the team delivered 9.9% which was a 90 basis point improvement compared to prior year of 9%. We continue to be pleased with the growth in our engineered products portfolio in our structures business this quarter which fully recovered from a one time expense in Q4 2024 2024. We did tell investors last quarter it was one time and kept our word. Adjusted EBITDA continues to grow compared to last year at 15.9%, a record for us as a percentage of sales up 3.5 million and almost 31 million. Fantastic progress. This is our second quarter with adjusted EBITDA above 30 million and it represents an expansion of 150 basis points above prior year and continues the strong momentum we saw in 2024 as we work towards the 18% goal in our Vision 2027 plan. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.69 a share in Q1 2025 versus $0.46 a share for Q1 2024 and with the adjustments diluted EPS was a strong $0.83 a share compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $0.70 a share compared in the prior year quarter. The higher GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS during the quarter was driven by improved operating income as well as lower interest costs due to lower interest rates along with a lower outstanding debt balance. The company's consolidated backlog continues to be strong at 1.05 billion, increasing 8 million year over year. The defense backlog increased over 50 million compared to the prior year quarter, no surprise there and is now at 620 million. The commercial aerospace backlog decreased by 31 million compared to the prior year quarter due to lower OEM production rates, but fully expected to come back in December 2022. We set a target of generating 25% plus of our revenue from engineered products, which was 9% in 2017 and 15% in 2022. In 2024 we reported that our engineered product business drove 23% of our total revenue, up from 19% in 2023, positioning us well ahead of the curve in achieving our Vision 2027 goal and certainly pushing for a lot more. We achieved this both through focused investment, driving organic growth in our current businesses as well as the BLR Aerospace acquisition in Q1 2025. We have maintained this mix at 23% and continue to work on both organic and inorganic opportunities to drive this hire. We made tremendous progress to date and I'm proud of our team and strategic plans. As for 2025 revenue, we are positioned to benefit from the expected Boeing recovery in the second half along with defense, which includes three programs mentioned earlier coming back online in Q2 and Q3. We are reaffirming our guide of mid single digit revenue growth for the year with Q2 being flattish to last year due to commercial aerospace including destocking, but anticipate good strength in the second half of 2025. In addition, we also believe tariffs will have a limited if any impact on our 2025 revenues. A good story for our investors. I want to reiterate as well that Ducommun is a US manufacturer with US employees and 95% of our revenue is produced in the US. Our only other facility is based in Guaymas, Mexico, Mexico and that production is less than 5% of our revenue and thankfully covered under the USMCA, exempting us from tariffs. The other good news is the common sales into China is almost entirely one program for an Airbus supplier who is owned by the government constitute less than 3% of our revenues and we have not seen any impact at this point on tariffs for ourselves. On the supplier side we do procure some parts from Europe and Asia, but it is manageable and so far the impact has been pretty de minimis. We will continue to monitor it as the situation evolves, but at this point we certainly don't see it as being something material to the company. To sum it up, the common in a lot of ways is the new trade policy with most of US manufacturing operations and US employees. Now let me provide some additional color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we saw revenues of $114 million compared to $99 million in Q1 2024. Growth was driven by missile programs such as the TOW and AMRAN, electronic warfare and radar programs including the NGJ, Aegis Combat System, Gator, and on the F16 and Blackhawk for fixed and rotary wing platforms. These are partially offset by weakness on the F35, Patriot and the V22. We also ended the first quarter with a backlog of 620 million, an increase of 51 million year over year, representing 59% of the common's total backlog. Within our commercial aerospace operations, first quarter revenue took a step backwards, declining 10% year over year in the quarter to 72 million, driven mainly by lower rates on the 737 Max Max commercial helicopters and in flight entertainment, partially offset by growth on the A320 and 787 Dreamliner. As I mentioned earlier, we believe that finally a much better story is ahead for BA and the MAX now that production is ramping up again after the strike. We have seen demand pick up at both Boeing and Spirit over the last few months. The backlog within our commercial aerospace business is 411 million at the end of the first quarter, decreasing 31 million compared to prior year driven by Boeing strike late last year and its impact on production rates. We expect this to recover as production rates ramp up in 2025. Revenue in our industrial business declined to 9 million during Q1 as we continue to strategically prune non core business from the portfolio. This will benefit the company in the long term as we transition that capacity to our core aerospace and defense platforms. With that, I'll have Suman review our financial results in detail."},{"end_time":"1617940","segment_id":4,"speaker":"Suman Mukaji","start_time":"958618","text":"Suman thank you, Steve. As a reminder, please see the company's 10-Q and Q1 earnings release for a further description of information mentioned on today's call. As Steve discussed, our first quarter results reflected another period of solid performance with strong growth in our military end markets. We also continue to make good progress on our facility consolidation projects which are nearing completion and will drive further synergies in late 2025 and into 2026 as we close out the recertification of the various product lines at the receiving facilities over the next few months. As Steve highlighted earlier, we also made great progress in continuing to build up our engineered product portfolio with those revenues now contributing 23% to our mix. These actions, along with our strategic pricing initiatives, drove continued margin expansion in Q1 and is keeping us on pace to achieve our Vision 2027 goals. Now turning to our first quarter results, revenue for the first quarter of 2025 was 194.1 million versus 1 90.8 million for the first quarter of 2024. The year over year increase of 1.7% reflects strong growth in military and space of 15% driven by increases in electronic warfare, missiles and radar systems. This was partially offset by weakness in our commercial aerospace business, mainly driven by lower revenues. On the 737 max. We posted total gross profit of 51.6 million or 26.6% of revenue for the quarter versus 46.9 million or 24.6% of revenue in the prior year period. We continue to provide adjusted gross margins as we had certain non GAAP cost of sales items in the prior year period relating to inventory, step up amortization on our acquisitions and restructuring charges. On an adjusted basis, our gross margins were 26.6% in Q1 2025 versus 25% in Q1 2024. The improvement in gross margin was driven by our growing engineered products portfolio, strategic pricing initiatives, productivity improvements and restructuring savings across both our Structural Systems and Electronic Systems segments. We also continue to make progress on supply chain and labor through our proactive efforts including strategic buys and our inventory investments. We have been able to avoid any significant impacts thus far on our business. Going forward, we will continue to work to improve the working capital turns in the business and improve our cash flow. I also want to add that we did not see any measurable impact from tariffs in the first quarter and as Steve mentioned, do not anticipate any significant impact to RP L. We are a US manufacturing business with US employees and generate 95% of revenues from our domestic facilities. The other 5% comes from Mexico and all that revenue is tariff free through the USMCA. Our sales are also largely to domestic customers, with US sales being in excess of 85% in 2024. Sales to China were less than 3%, mostly to one customer for Airbus, and there has been no impact to those volumes or orders at this time due to the tariffs. Our supply chain is also largely domestic with less than 5% of our direct suppliers being foreign. Some of our domestic suppliers do source materials from outside the United States, but even that is a very manageable spend with China being a low single digit percentage. We expect to mitigate the impact of tariffs on our material spend through military duty free exemptions, alternate sourcing of materials from domestic suppliers, or by passing on the impact to our customers Newcomen reported operating income for the first quarter of 16.6 million, or 8.5% of revenue, compared to 12.6 million, or 6.6% of revenue in the prior year period. Adjusted operating income was 19.2 million, or 9.9% of revenue this quarter, compared to 17.1 million, or 9% of revenue in the comparable period last year. The Company reported net income for the first quarter of 2025 of 10.5 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, compared to net income of 6.8 million, or $0.46 per diluted share a year ago. On an adjusted basis, the Company reported net income of 12.6 million, or $0.83 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of 10.4 million, or $0.70 in Q1 2024. The higher net income and adjusted net income during the quarter was driven by the higher operating income and adjusted operating income. Now let me turn to our segment results. Our structural systems segment posted revenue of 84.4 million in the first quarter of 2025 versus 83.3 million last year. The year over year increase reflected 2.3 million of fire sales across our military and space applications including Black Hawk and tow. Commercial aerospace was down just 2%, driven primarily by a decline in 737 Max and commercial helicopters. Structural systems operating income for the quarter was $10.4 million, or 12.3% of revenue, compared to $2.9 million, or 3.4% of revenue for the prior year quarter. Excluding restructuring charges and other adjustments in both years, the segment operating margin was 14.9% in Q1 2025 versus 7.8% in Q1 2024. In Q4 2024, we had noted unfavorable program mix and onetime costs impacting the profitability of the segment. We had highlighted these as temporary with an expected recovery in Q1 2025. Our performance here in Q1 2025 validates those comments as we saw a strong recovery in the margins of the structural system segment. Our electronic systems segment posted revenue of 109.7 million in the first quarter of 2025 versus 107.5 million in the prior year period. Higher revenues from TOW and AMRAAM missiles as well as from electronic warfare and radar programs were partially offset by Lower revenues from F35 in flight entertainment Electronics along with a reduction in our industrial business as we chose to selectively prune non core work. We have been pruning our industrial business now for multiple quarters, maintaining only select customers that are accretive to our business. Electronic systems operating income for the first quarter was 18.1 million or 16.5% of revenue versus 19 million or 17.6% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding restructuring charges and other adjustments in both years, the segment operating margin was 16.9% in Q1 2025 versus 18.4% in Q1 2024. The year over year decrease was primarily due to lower manufacturing volume and higher manufacturing costs, partially offset by favorable product mix in the quarter. Next, I would like to provide an update on our ongoing restructuring program. As a reminder and as discussed previously, we commenced a restructuring initiative back in 2022. These actions are being taken to better position the company for stronger performance in the short and long term. This includes the shutdown of our facilities in Monrovia, California, and Berryville, Arkansas and the transfer of that work to our low cost operation in Guaymas, Mexico and to other existing performance centers in the United States. We continue to make progress on these transitions and are working diligently with our customers Boeing and RTX to obtain the requisite approvals which are expected to be completed by the end of Q3. Later this month we expect to start full production of rotor blades for the Apache helicopter at our Coxsackie, New York facility which will complete the transition of that program from our Monrovia, California facility. We are also working through the transition of 737 Max spoilers, Tomahawk harnesses and the DOE missile case which are all expected to go into production in Guaymas in the second half of this year. During Q1 2025 we recorded 0.4 million in net restructuring charges. We expect to incur an additional 0.5 to 1 million in restructuring expenses as we complete the program. As previously communicated, we expect to generate 11 to 13 million in annual savings from our actions and have already seen some realization of savings in 2024 and the first quarter of this year. We expect the synergies to ramp UP in late 2025 and into 2026 as the product recertification is complete and the receiving facilities move up the learning curve and ramp up production. We anticipate selling the land and buildings at both Monrovia, California, and Berryville, Arkansas during the quarter we reclassified the Berryville land, buildings and building improvements to assets held for sale and are making progress towards the sale of that property in Q2. Turning now to liquidity and capital resources, in Q1 2025 we generated $0.8 million in cash flow from operating activities from operating activities which was an improvement compared to use of $1.6 million in Q1 2024. The improvement was due to net income growth of $3.7 million offset by investments in working capital. As of the end of the first quarter, we had available liquidity of 221.7 million comprising of the unutilized portion of our revolver and cash on hand. Our existing credit facility was put in place in July 2022 at an opportune time in the credit markets, allowing us to reduce our spread, increase the size of our revolver and allowing us the flexibility to execute on our acquisition strategy. Interest expense in Q1 2025 was 3.3 million compared to 3.9 million in Q1 of 2024. The year over year improvement in interest cost was primarily due to lower interest rate along with a lower debt balance. In November 2021 we put in place an interest rate hedge that went into effect for a seven year period starting January 2024 and pegs the one month term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) at 170 basis points for $150 million of our debt. The hedge will continue to drive significant interest savings in 2025 and beyond. To conclude the financial review for Q1 2025, I would like to say that the first quarter results are a strong start to the year. Building on the momentum from 2024 positions us well for the rest of 2025 and beyond. I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks."},{"end_time":"1689250","segment_id":5,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"1618100","text":"Steve, okay, thanks iman. In closing, Q1 was an excellent start to the year despite the anticipated headwind from commercial aerospace. As mentioned several times, we achieved another record for gross margin percentage at 26.6%. And just keep in mind a few years ago, we had a run rate of roughly 20% for an entire year and that was back in 2022. So we've come a long way in two years and could not be happy about that. Adjusted EBITDA percentage was great and a record as well at 15.9% of sales. We're also very well positioned to meet and exceed our vision 2027 target. 25% plus of engineered product revenues with 2021. 2025 Q1 coming in at 23%. And we're getting this as high as possible as it is our number one strategic focus. Finally, with commercial bill rates heading higher in the second half, getting past destocking along with stronger defense activity, I'm very optimistic about what lies ahead in the next few years for dco, its shareholders and other stakeholders. Okay, let's go to questions, please. Thank you."},{"end_time":"1715170","segment_id":6,"speaker":"UNKNOWN","start_time":"1690030","text":"Thank you.

We're seeing rates from Spirit ramp up to the mid to high 20s. As we went through Q1 and into April, we know publicly that Boeing is likely producing at in the low 30s at the moment. So there is some destocking impact that we are seeing. But the rates continue to progress and go up over the last four months this year. And so we are very optimistic that they will continue to be, despite the destocking, continued growth in the demand for us on both those platforms. The expectation is that Boeing is able to get to their rate of 38 by the end of this year."},{"end_time":"1813530","segment_id":10,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"1792574","text":"Yeah, Mike, this is Steve. I'm very confident where they are. They had a great April, as you can see from the announcements they made. March to April was really impressive.

So we're going to see a lift."},{"end_time":"1841490","segment_id":11,"speaker":"Mike Crawford","start_time":"1815640","text":"Okay, thank you. And then just turning to rotary wing, you had some weakness, but you also had some quote selected rotary wing platforms with higher rates. I take it that's Apache or Apache blades are coming on in Q2. So what was performing higher in Q1 and how much of this would you attribute to BLR Aerospace?"},{"end_time":"1847374","segment_id":12,"speaker":"UNKNOWN","start_time":"1842870","text":"So we did, as you rightly pointed, on the defense side of our business."},{"end_time":"1848250","segment_id":13,"speaker":"UNKNOWN","start_time":"1847542","text":"See."},{"end_time":"1892630","segment_id":14,"speaker":"UNKNOWN","start_time":"1851030","text":"Well, the weakness that you pointed out we saw on the commercial side. We have some transitions ongoing with production moving from Monrovia to Coxsackie,. And so some demand with the Bell Helicopter, some issues with materials on Sikorsky platforms, which drove temporary softness in the quarter on commercial helicopter. But we are going to see the Apache production here ramp up, which should be really a positive in Q2 and beyond on the rotorcraft side for us."},{"end_time":"1927360","segment_id":15,"speaker":"UNKNOWN","start_time":"1892670","text":"Yeah, plus Mike, we're on the Apache engine with MagSeal. So that's also. They're going great with the engine business there. So that's a part of that lift. But you know, we might have this and that with blades right now, but now we're just starting to get ramped up. We cut the blades, Boeing looked at them, everything's looking great. We got everybody trained out in New York. So we're hoping, you know, obviously these are high energy parts, you got to be careful. But you know, we're hoping in May we're going to start really ramping up and we got the orders, we just got to get the production in place."},{"end_time":"1942068","segment_id":16,"speaker":"Mike Crawford","start_time":"1929340","text":"Okay, thank you. I just end with the Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) increase in Q1, is that anything structural or contractual that changed or should we look for those Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)s to come back down?"},{"end_time":"1964470","segment_id":17,"speaker":"UNKNOWN","start_time":"1942124","text":"Thank you, that's a good point. So we did have just some seasonality in the sales in Q1. We had slightly bigger March. We had some items that went out towards the end of the quarter that drove it. But there isn't any structural change. It was just the seasonality, a one time kind of thing during the quarter."},{"end_time":"1966474","segment_id":18,"speaker":"UNKNOWN","start_time":"1965250","text":"All right, thank you."},{"end_time":"1967950","segment_id":19,"speaker":"UNKNOWN","start_time":"1966642","text":"Yeah, Mike, thanks."},{"end_time":"1975510","segment_id":20,"speaker":"UNKNOWN","start_time":"1968770","text":"Thank you.

I wanted to ask first on the M&A pipeline, you obviously have placeholder for M&A contribution. As we think about Vision 2027, it's been quite recently on the deal front. Are you still tracking towards the placeholder you've got in place for 27 from M& A? And maybe can you give any more detail on how the pipeline looks now and due diligence efforts and maybe expectations for M&A this year."},{"end_time":"2043030","segment_id":22,"speaker":"Suman Mukaji","start_time":"2011960","text":"So we. Ken, thank you for the question and good morning to you as well. We continue to track multiple opportunities in our pipeline and, you know, we've got to be disciplined and make sure we execute on the right one. We see enough in the pipeline for us to feel fairly confident in being able to get a deal done this year. And I think that's, that's what."},{"end_time":"2061300","segment_id":23,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"2043330","text":"Yeah, I would say the deal volume is good.. You know, we just, we just looked at something fairly hard and did a lot of, put a lot of hours in on it and turned out it just wasn't for us. So we're, we're involved in diligence, as you asked, and we're looking forward to getting one sooner than later. Ken."},{"end_time":"2070620","segment_id":24,"speaker":"Ken Herbert","start_time":"2062360","text":"Okay, that's helpful. And are you seeing more in aerospace or defense or combined or anything? Maybe we should just keep in mind."},{"end_time":"2088658","segment_id":25,"speaker":"Suman Mukaji","start_time":"2072440","text":"I would say the businesses that we look at tend to be niche engineered product businesses, which often will span across some defense platforms as well as commercial aerospace. So there is a mix of both. It isn't necessarily skewed one way or the other."},{"end_time":"2097950","segment_id":26,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"2088714","text":"Yeah, I would say that's right, Ken. I'd say we usually have sort of a mix. It's usually never, you know, 100% one way or the other.

And just finally, you seem to be running ahead of your 27 targets in terms of contribution from the engineered products. And if you do another deal this year, I'm assuming it would be, you know, very focused on the engineered products. How should we think about the, maybe the margin contribution from these engineered products? You talk obviously a lot about the sales contribution to maybe help us understand how impactful this could be as you grow that mix to the ebitda. I mean, I can imagine it's been a big component of obviously just the margin improvement on the gross margins and ebitda. But any help you can give in framing that as we think moving forward on the engineered products would be nice. Thank you."},{"end_time":"2158906","segment_id":28,"speaker":"Suman Mukaji","start_time":"2141090","text":"Great question, Ken. And these are significantly accretive to our margins. Right. These are engineered proprietary product businesses with access to the aftermarket and in line with some of the other aftermarket peers that you, that you covered."},{"end_time":"2159130","segment_id":29,"speaker":"UNKNOWN","start_time":"2158938","text":"Right."},{"end_time":"2179066","segment_id":30,"speaker":"Suman Mukaji","start_time":"2159170","text":"Margins are in line with those, so they tend to be accretive. They tend to provide also significant margin Runway for us to execute on post Acquisition. And so we believe that this is going to continue to be, as we do, additional acquisitions, a key driver of margin expansion for us into 2027."},{"end_time":"2189670","segment_id":31,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"2179138","text":"Yeah, Kel, also we have, you know, as far as the value we provide for these products, I mean, we have very good pricing power.

Really nice margins here. Maybe Steve or Suman just to kind of level set us and unpack maybe the revenue guidance for the rest of the year. Mid single digit growth Defense obviously had a really strong, strong quarter here, but the comps do get a bit tougher and you're obviously going to have some of this recovery in Commercial Aero. But maybe how are you thinking about the growth rates between commercial Arrow and Defense for the remainder of the year?"},{"end_time":"2293666","segment_id":37,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"2241000","text":"Yeah, let me jump in there first. I think first thing, Mike, just to note, this is a real benefit for shareholders that we have this mix of defense and commercial. Right. We've had a lot of peer groups that or peers that, you know, have more commercial and they're struggling a bit. But as you can see, our defense business we've been talking about really came to the, came to the fore, as they say in Q1. So first of all, we're really pleased with our balance as far as what I can see. Obviously we're flattish in Q2, but we feel very good about destocking and, and commercial rates going up not only on the 737 Max, but on the 787 Dreamliner. Right. Because we have a very good content mix there. So very positive on the back half. And I think maybe defense going forward, maybe not 15, but certainly a very respectable growth number. Suman."},{"end_time":"2312842","segment_id":38,"speaker":"Suman Mukaji","start_time":"2293778","text":"The only thing I'd add there, Steve, is that we're going to see the ramp up in the programs that have been transitioning. Right. So we have the, the TOW missile cases,, spoilers and the Tomahawk program. So across commercial and defense, we're going to get some lift in the back half from those programs coming back online."},{"end_time":"2316150","segment_id":39,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"2312946","text":"Yeah. Which is going to be great for everyone."},{"end_time":"2332952","segment_id":40,"speaker":"Michael Chermoli","start_time":"2316850","text":"Okay, got it. What about the A220? You know, I know Airbus commentary around both the 220 and 350 have been a little bit squishy just given the Spirit facilities. Do you expect that to be a material contributor to the A220 this year?"},{"end_time":"2376950","segment_id":41,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"2333056","text":"Look, you know. Yeah. So a Couple of things. First, you know that a220 program's been great for us. As we talked about, we make the, you know, the fuselage skins, we're a supplier into China. Haven't seen any headwind yet. So we feel very good about that. So that's going to continue. We feel, you know, as far as where we sit here today, it's going to again be good business this year leading to next year. Understand about the Spirit issue and the engine issue and you know, I'm hoping sooner or later they're going to work through that. But you know, we're running rates higher than what they're shipping, that's for sure. And we're happy about that. The other thing is on the A350, we're really, we're not a player on the A350. So I know they're struggling. It won't impact us."},{"end_time":"2404810","segment_id":42,"speaker":"Michael Chermoli","start_time":"2377330","text":"Got it, Got it. And last one for me, I think you called out the in-flight entertainment side of commercial as being weak. I was just wondering if you could potentially size that business. What are the thoughts there? Just given that that's maybe viewed as more discretionary spending from the airlines, does that continue to be a headwind for the remainder of the year or was that just kind of short term here, temporary."},{"end_time":"2423268","segment_id":43,"speaker":"Suman Mukaji","start_time":"2406830","text":"That it's not a huge portion of our business. It's low single digit percentage of our total business. I think we'll continue to see some softness there for the rest of this year that we expect will be offset by other things in the portfolio."},{"end_time":"2443840","segment_id":44,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"2423364","text":"Mike, I think the compares get a little bit easier. We had a really good Q1 20, 24 with inflight, you know what I mean? That's one customer, so. And obviously we didn't have a great rest of the year. Things kind of tamped out a bit.

Okay, thanks. Certainly. It's funny you asked that. We have our senior VP out at Spirit actually today meeting with them in Wichita. So, you know, we have very close relationship with Spirit. They're obviously a top customer of ours and we do see more opportunity, especially as things ramp up. Okay, so for instance, we just got going on a 737 Max skins. And you know, that's early on. Right. So we do four or five skins and we do 15 a month. That's the deal we have. Right. So it's not paid by the drink. And, you know, we feel very good about, you know, increasing business there. We understand there's delivery challenges. We're pretty much 100% on time. We're pretty close to both Airbus and Spirit, Boeing, and Airbus. So our operations are very strong. So we think there is growth there. You know, we're continuing to work with them. I think the skins is sort of in the lead as well as maybe some other things. And as well as Airbus, we're getting quoted heavily by Airbus, frankly, because some of the other suppliers are not getting the job done. You know, whether that. Whether that changes hands, we'll have to see. But you know, we see a lot of growth activity as far as quoting at this point. So I think that's, I think, a good story. I think if you look at our just percentage of what we have on the programs in general and our operation performance, it's all very positive. You want to add on the second."},{"end_time":"2633996","segment_id":56,"speaker":"Suman Mukaji","start_time":"2609780","text":"Part or on the defense side? I think we are continuing to see numerous opportunities to bid for work. RTX is a big customer for us, our biggest customer. And we are actively bidding both a lot of new work with them.

I mean, you know, we're really good. Right. So, you know, we picked up a lot from RTX that used to make, you know, these cards in Massachusetts. And, you know, now that's coming our way in Tulsa and we have other things we're working on with Northrop. So, you know, that's not changing. And I've been bullish on defense. I've Been telling investors, look, you know, these things take time and they do, because when you're moving something from an internal operation at RTX to Tulsa, they're not going to give you everything at first. You're going to get 50%, you got to get testing machines. So all this is going to come together for us, I believe, in this year and next year. So I was very happy with the 15%.

You know, we really feel, you know, very good and strong about being a part of this, you know, trillion dollar budget, being able to support, you know, all these customers. I mentioned in my remarks that, you know, we've in the past, right or wrongly, we were a big Raytheon house, as they would say. And now we're moving in much more to Northrop. We're moving into BAE Systems,. You know, we're moving into some of these other companies on purpose, right, to kind of build out this customer base. And we got a lot of things to provide cablesling. We're great at that, we're great at cards. So, you know, we think that we're in the right position. And you know, as I mentioned earlier, you know, not only the budget, but also customers like Raytheon Technologies (RTX) are offloading, right? They're offloading the driving margins. They might be three or four years into a program with seven year fixed pricing and they have nowhere to go. So they're going to move stuff out and they're going to try to drive margins that way as a company. So it's all looking good."},{"end_time":"2829152","segment_id":63,"speaker":"UNKNOWN","start_time":"2825640","text":"Tony, nice job positioning yourself."},{"end_time":"2833500","segment_id":64,"speaker":"UNKNOWN","start_time":"2829216","text":"Reach out to you Banks, thanks very much.

I think you had last quarter talked about 1Q being flat, 2Q a little better. The 1Q actual is a little better. Still feel the same about 2Q or is that looking better? And I guess, you know, the defense growth rate's quite high in the quarter. As others have noted, the compares get a little tougher there through the rest of the year, but not that much tougher. And Aero is just down significantly in the first quarter. And you know, Boeing was on strike and had things turned off or I guess was coming out of the strike. So I don't know, maybe I'm splitting hairs on the mid single for the full year, but it's a little tough to get there. I guess if things break the right way, maybe it's just early in the year and it's a dynamic macro and you're being conservative.

Good afternoon. So great question. On the commercial aerospace side, I would say that so if you look at Boeing and airbus, they're about 50% of our total commercial aerospace business. So we do expect that to ramp up in the second half of the year. But I wouldn't apply that growth rate on our entire commercial aerospace revenue. Right. So 50%. The other 50%. The other 50% includes business jets and rotorcraft and other things. But there will be growth there. There will be continued strength in the defense business, as Steve mentioned earlier, may not be at the 1520, but we do expect based on the programs and the visibility we have the rest of the year, there's going to be continued strength there. And then we have also the ramp up on the programs that have moved from one facility to another and are currently kind of in hibernation but expected to ramp up in the second half of the year. They include tow missile case, they include the spoilers in the 737 Max as well as the Tomahawk harnesses, along with the Apache blade,. So those are all expected to give us Some lift in the second half. So we see good growth in commercial aerospace, good growth in defense to kind of get us to that mid single digit number for the full year."},{"end_time":"3010810","segment_id":70,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"2991864","text":"Yeah, no, I'd also say look, you know, we're okay. Is it a little conservative right now? Yeah, we want to really see how the second quarter goes with BA and Spirit. Obviously that's a big part of our growth story.

I think if we do get an acquisition, it likely to exceed or get very close to kind of the 25% again, depends on the timing also of the acquisition and how much of revenues are contributed.

So we kind of are there already in Q1, but it does have 50 to 75 basis points of I would say mix goodness in it. So, you know, we'll continue to see, I think good margins for the rest of the year.

Okay, thanks Saman and thanks everyone for joining us today for our first quarter conference call. Today as usual, I will give an update of the current situation at the company. Afterwards, Simone will review our financials in detail. Let me start off again on this quarterly call with Ducommun's Vision 2027 game plan for investors as we start our third year in 2025. The strategy and vision were developed coming out of the COVID pandemic over the summer and fall of 2022, unanimously approved by the Common Board in November 2022, then presented to investors the following month in New York where we got excellent feedback. Since that time the Commons management has been executing the Vision 2027 strategy. This includes increasing the revenue percentage of engineered product and aftermarket content which finished at 23% for 2024 up from 19% in 2023 consolidating our rooftop footprint and contract manufacturing continuing the targeted acquisition program executing our offloading strategy with defense primes and high growth segments of the defense budget, driving value added pricing and expanded content on key commercial aerospace platforms. All of us here as well as my fellow board members continue to have a high level of conviction in the Vision 2027 strategy and financial goals and believe the many catalysts ahead present unique value creation opportunity for shareholders. The Q1 2025 results are another example of our strategy and initiatives working. Just look at the margin expansion, performance and much more to come this year and in 2026. Despite the challenges discussed on our prior earnings call, I'm happy to report Q1 sales of 1.94.1 million which was 1.7% over prior year, making this quarter our 16th consecutive quarter with year over year growth in revenue team achieved this despite the headwinds in commercial aerospace bill rates, destocking at Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems and the continued strategic pruning of our non core industrial business. It was also our seventh consecutive quarter above $190 million in revenue. Strong growth in our missile and electronic warfare along with military helicopter programs drove our military and space revenue to 15% growth over prior year. This includes not just order increases but also major programs I've been speaking about coming online, such as the offload of the next generation Jammer from RTX and Amran. Our defense business looks great with Apache blades coming back online in Q2. Tom wild cables along with the tow missile case in Q3. We can't wait. I also want to point out that three of our top five customers in Q1 were defense primes and that is consistent with all of 2024 as well. Our team continues to build scale at other defense customers outside of RTX which is and has been a long term goal. Northrop Grumman is a great example of this strategic effort. The strong growth in our defense business more than offset lower revenue in our commercial aerospace business which declined 10% in the quarter and was anticipated. This is the first commercial aerospace decline in the past 15 quarters for DCO. We had tough compares in Q1 as both Boeing and Spirit drove higher demand during this period last year. We have seen steady improvement in demand with both these customers over the course of Q1 2025 coming out of the Boeing strike in Q4 2024 of last year and the outlook is promising. I also want to add that everything we are seeing out of Boeing commercial last few months has been very encouraging Both on the 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner our main platforms. We are optimistic that bill rates will be at 38 soon on the 737 Max. Gross margin also grew $4.7 million to 26.6% in Q1, which is a new quarterly record of 200 basis points year over year from 24.6% as we continue to realize year over year benefits from our growing engineered products portfolio with aftermarket strategic value pricing initiatives, restructuring actions and productivity improvements. We have ceased manufacturing operations both on Monrovia, California and and Berryville, Arkansas facilities and are already seeing cost savings from this action. We expect to see these savings be higher as the receiving plants ramp up production later this year and fully in 2026. Stay tuned for adjusted operating income margins. In Q1 the team delivered 9.9% which was a 90 basis point improvement compared to prior year of 9%. We continue to be pleased with the growth in our engineered products portfolio in our structures business this quarter which fully recovered from a one time expense in Q4 2024 2024. We did tell investors last quarter it was one time and kept our word. Adjusted EBITDA continues to grow compared to last year at 15.9%, a record for us as a percentage of sales up 3.5 million and almost 31 million. Fantastic progress. This is our second quarter with adjusted EBITDA above 30 million and it represents an expansion of 150 basis points above prior year and continues the strong momentum we saw in 2024 as we work towards the 18% goal in our Vision 2027 plan. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.69 a share in Q1 2025 versus $0.46 a share for Q1 2024 and with the adjustments diluted EPS was a strong $0.83 a share compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $0.70 a share compared in the prior year quarter. The higher GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS during the quarter was driven by improved operating income as well as lower interest costs due to lower interest rates along with a lower outstanding debt balance. The company's consolidated backlog continues to be strong at 1.05 billion, increasing 8 million year over year. The defense backlog increased over 50 million compared to the prior year quarter, no surprise there and is now at 620 million. The commercial aerospace backlog decreased by 31 million compared to the prior year quarter due to lower OEM production rates, but fully expected to come back in December 2022. We set a target of generating 25% plus of our revenue from engineered products, which was 9% in 2017 and 15% in 2022. In 2024 we reported that our engineered product business drove 23% of our total revenue, up from 19% in 2023, positioning us well ahead of the curve in achieving our Vision 2027 goal and certainly pushing for a lot more. We achieved this both through focused investment, driving organic growth in our current businesses as well as the BLR Aerospace acquisition in Q1 2025. We have maintained this mix at 23% and continue to work on both organic and inorganic opportunities to drive this hire. We made tremendous progress to date and I'm proud of our team and strategic plans. As for 2025 revenue, we are positioned to benefit from the expected Boeing recovery in the second half along with defense, which includes three programs mentioned earlier coming back online in Q2 and Q3. We are reaffirming our guide of mid single digit revenue growth for the year with Q2 being flattish to last year due to commercial aerospace including destocking, but anticipate good strength in the second half of 2025. In addition, we also believe tariffs will have a limited if any impact on our 2025 revenues. A good story for our investors. I want to reiterate as well that Ducommun is a US manufacturer with US employees and 95% of our revenue is produced in the US. Our only other facility is based in Guaymas, Mexico, Mexico and that production is less than 5% of our revenue and thankfully covered under the USMCA, exempting us from tariffs. The other good news is the common sales into China is almost entirely one program for an Airbus supplier who is owned by the government constitute less than 3% of our revenues and we have not seen any impact at this point on tariffs for ourselves. On the supplier side we do procure some parts from Europe and Asia, but it is manageable and so far the impact has been pretty de minimis. We will continue to monitor it as the situation evolves, but at this point we certainly don't see it as being something material to the company. To sum it up, the common in a lot of ways is the new trade policy with most of US manufacturing operations and US employees. Now let me provide some additional color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we saw revenues of $114 million compared to $99 million in Q1 2024. Growth was driven by missile programs such as the TOW and AMRAN, electronic warfare and radar programs including the NGJ, Aegis Combat System, Gator, and on the F16 and Blackhawk for fixed and rotary wing platforms. These are partially offset by weakness on the F35, Patriot and the V22. We also ended the first quarter with a backlog of 620 million, an increase of 51 million year over year, representing 59% of the common's total backlog. Within our commercial aerospace operations, first quarter revenue took a step backwards, declining 10% year over year in the quarter to 72 million, driven mainly by lower rates on the 737 Max Max commercial helicopters and in flight entertainment, partially offset by growth on the A320 and 787 Dreamliner. As I mentioned earlier, we believe that finally a much better story is ahead for BA and the MAX now that production is ramping up again after the strike. We have seen demand pick up at both Boeing and Spirit over the last few months. The backlog within our commercial aerospace business is 411 million at the end of the first quarter, decreasing 31 million compared to prior year driven by Boeing strike late last year and its impact on production rates. We expect this to recover as production rates ramp up in 2025. Revenue in our industrial business declined to 9 million during Q1 as we continue to strategically prune non core business from the portfolio. This will benefit the company in the long term as we transition that capacity to our core aerospace and defense platforms. With that, I'll have Suman review our financial results in detail. Suman thank you, Steve. As a reminder, please see the company's 10-Q and Q1 earnings release for a further description of information mentioned on today's call. As Steve discussed, our first quarter results reflected another period of solid performance with strong growth in our military end markets. We also continue to make good progress on our facility consolidation projects which are nearing completion and will drive further synergies in late 2025 and into 2026 as we close out the recertification of the various product lines at the receiving facilities over the next few months. As Steve highlighted earlier, we also made great progress in continuing to build up our engineered product portfolio with those revenues now contributing 23% to our mix. These actions, along with our strategic pricing initiatives, drove continued margin expansion in Q1 and is keeping us on pace to achieve our Vision 2027 goals. Now turning to our first quarter results, revenue for the first quarter of 2025 was 194.1 million versus 1 90.8 million for the first quarter of 2024. The year over year increase of 1.7% reflects strong growth in military and space of 15% driven by increases in electronic warfare, missiles and radar systems. This was partially offset by weakness in our commercial aerospace business, mainly driven by lower revenues. On the 737 max. We posted total gross profit of 51.6 million or 26.6% of revenue for the quarter versus 46.9 million or 24.6% of revenue in the prior year period. We continue to provide adjusted gross margins as we had certain non GAAP cost of sales items in the prior year period relating to inventory, step up amortization on our acquisitions and restructuring charges. On an adjusted basis, our gross margins were 26.6% in Q1 2025 versus 25% in Q1 2024. The improvement in gross margin was driven by our growing engineered products portfolio, strategic pricing initiatives, productivity improvements and restructuring savings across both our Structural Systems and Electronic Systems segments. We also continue to make progress on supply chain and labor through our proactive efforts including strategic buys and our inventory investments. We have been able to avoid any significant impacts thus far on our business. Going forward, we will continue to work to improve the working capital turns in the business and improve our cash flow. I also want to add that we did not see any measurable impact from tariffs in the first quarter and as Steve mentioned, do not anticipate any significant impact to RP L. We are a US manufacturing business with US employees and generate 95% of revenues from our domestic facilities. The other 5% comes from Mexico and all that revenue is tariff free through the USMCA. Our sales are also largely to domestic customers, with US sales being in excess of 85% in 2024. Sales to China were less than 3%, mostly to one customer for Airbus, and there has been no impact to those volumes or orders at this time due to the tariffs. Our supply chain is also largely domestic with less than 5% of our direct suppliers being foreign. Some of our domestic suppliers do source materials from outside the United States, but even that is a very manageable spend with China being a low single digit percentage. We expect to mitigate the impact of tariffs on our material spend through military duty free exemptions, alternate sourcing of materials from domestic suppliers, or by passing on the impact to our customers Newcomen reported operating income for the first quarter of 16.6 million, or 8.5% of revenue, compared to 12.6 million, or 6.6% of revenue in the prior year period. Adjusted operating income was 19.2 million, or 9.9% of revenue this quarter, compared to 17.1 million, or 9% of revenue in the comparable period last year. The Company reported net income for the first quarter of 2025 of 10.5 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, compared to net income of 6.8 million, or $0.46 per diluted share a year ago. On an adjusted basis, the Company reported net income of 12.6 million, or $0.83 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of 10.4 million, or $0.70 in Q1 2024. The higher net income and adjusted net income during the quarter was driven by the higher operating income and adjusted operating income. Now let me turn to our segment results. Our structural systems segment posted revenue of 84.4 million in the first quarter of 2025 versus 83.3 million last year. The year over year increase reflected 2.3 million of fire sales across our military and space applications including Black Hawk and tow. Commercial aerospace was down just 2%, driven primarily by a decline in 737 Max and commercial helicopters. Structural systems operating income for the quarter was $10.4 million, or 12.3% of revenue, compared to $2.9 million, or 3.4% of revenue for the prior year quarter. Excluding restructuring charges and other adjustments in both years, the segment operating margin was 14.9% in Q1 2025 versus 7.8% in Q1 2024. In Q4 2024, we had noted unfavorable program mix and onetime costs impacting the profitability of the segment. We had highlighted these as temporary with an expected recovery in Q1 2025. Our performance here in Q1 2025 validates those comments as we saw a strong recovery in the margins of the structural system segment. Our electronic systems segment posted revenue of 109.7 million in the first quarter of 2025 versus 107.5 million in the prior year period. Higher revenues from TOW and AMRAAM missiles as well as from electronic warfare and radar programs were partially offset by Lower revenues from F35 in flight entertainment Electronics along with a reduction in our industrial business as we chose to selectively prune non core work. We have been pruning our industrial business now for multiple quarters, maintaining only select customers that are accretive to our business. Electronic systems operating income for the first quarter was 18.1 million or 16.5% of revenue versus 19 million or 17.6% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding restructuring charges and other adjustments in both years, the segment operating margin was 16.9% in Q1 2025 versus 18.4% in Q1 2024. The year over year decrease was primarily due to lower manufacturing volume and higher manufacturing costs, partially offset by favorable product mix in the quarter. Next, I would like to provide an update on our ongoing restructuring program. As a reminder and as discussed previously, we commenced a restructuring initiative back in 2022. These actions are being taken to better position the company for stronger performance in the short and long term. This includes the shutdown of our facilities in Monrovia, California, and Berryville, Arkansas and the transfer of that work to our low cost operation in Guaymas, Mexico and to other existing performance centers in the United States. We continue to make progress on these transitions and are working diligently with our customers Boeing and RTX to obtain the requisite approvals which are expected to be completed by the end of Q3. Later this month we expect to start full production of rotor blades for the Apache helicopter at our Coxsackie, New York facility which will complete the transition of that program from our Monrovia, California facility. We are also working through the transition of 737 Max spoilers, Tomahawk harnesses and the DOE missile case which are all expected to go into production in Guaymas in the second half of this year. During Q1 2025 we recorded 0.4 million in net restructuring charges. We expect to incur an additional 0.5 to 1 million in restructuring expenses as we complete the program. As previously communicated, we expect to generate 11 to 13 million in annual savings from our actions and have already seen some realization of savings in 2024 and the first quarter of this year. We expect the synergies to ramp UP in late 2025 and into 2026 as the product recertification is complete and the receiving facilities move up the learning curve and ramp up production. We anticipate selling the land and buildings at both Monrovia, California, and Berryville, Arkansas during the quarter we reclassified the Berryville land, buildings and building improvements to assets held for sale and are making progress towards the sale of that property in Q2. Turning now to liquidity and capital resources, in Q1 2025 we generated $0.8 million in cash flow from operating activities from operating activities which was an improvement compared to use of $1.6 million in Q1 2024. The improvement was due to net income growth of $3.7 million offset by investments in working capital. As of the end of the first quarter, we had available liquidity of 221.7 million comprising of the unutilized portion of our revolver and cash on hand. Our existing credit facility was put in place in July 2022 at an opportune time in the credit markets, allowing us to reduce our spread, increase the size of our revolver and allowing us the flexibility to execute on our acquisition strategy. Interest expense in Q1 2025 was 3.3 million compared to 3.9 million in Q1 of 2024. The year over year improvement in interest cost was primarily due to lower interest rate along with a lower debt balance. In November 2021 we put in place an interest rate hedge that went into effect for a seven year period starting January 2024 and pegs the one month term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) at 170 basis points for $150 million of our debt. The hedge will continue to drive significant interest savings in 2025 and beyond. To conclude the financial review for Q1 2025, I would like to say that the first quarter results are a strong start to the year. Building on the momentum from 2024 positions us well for the rest of 2025 and beyond. I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve, okay, thanks iman. In closing, Q1 was an excellent start to the year despite the anticipated headwind from commercial aerospace. As mentioned several times, we achieved another record for gross margin percentage at 26.6%. And just keep in mind a few years ago, we had a run rate of roughly 20% for an entire year and that was back in 2022. So we've come a long way in two years and could not be happy about that. Adjusted EBITDA percentage was great and a record as well at 15.9% of sales. We're also very well positioned to meet and exceed our vision 2027 target. 25% plus of engineered product revenues with 2021. 2025 Q1 coming in at 23%. And we're getting this as high as possible as it is our number one strategic focus. Finally, with commercial bill rates heading higher in the second half, getting past destocking along with stronger defense activity, I'm very optimistic about what lies ahead in the next few years for dco, its shareholders and other stakeholders. Okay, let's go to questions, please. Thank you. Thank you. At this time, we will conduct a question and answer session. As a reminder to ask a question, you will need to press Star 11 on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press star 11 again. One moment. While we compile the Q and A roster, our first question comes from the line of Mike Crawford with B. Riley Securities. Your line is now open. Thank you. Starting with commercial aerospace, I mean, we know that Boeing is increasing their monthly build rates, but how would you characterize any delay in when your shipset rates to Boeing? Spirit would increase if Boeing does get production up to. If Boeing does get production up to. 38 per month. We are seeing rates from Boeing in the low 20s. We're seeing rates from Spirit ramp up to the mid to high 20s. As we went through Q1 and into April, we know publicly that Boeing is likely producing at in the low 30s at the moment. So there is some destocking impact that we are seeing. But the rates continue to progress and go up over the last four months this year. And so we are very optimistic that they will continue to be, despite the destocking, continued growth in the demand for us on both those platforms. The expectation is that Boeing is able to get to their rate of 38 by the end of this year. Yeah, Mike, this is Steve. I'm very confident where they are. They had a great April, as you can see from the announcements they made. March to April was really impressive. I think their efficiency and everything they're doing within Puget Sound has gotten a lot better. I think 38 is in the Cards probably maybe by September, October. So we're going to see a lift. Okay, thank you. And then just turning to rotary wing, you had some weakness, but you also had some quote selected rotary wing platforms with higher rates. I take it that's Apache or Apache blades are coming on in Q2. So what was performing higher in Q1 and how much of this would you attribute to BLR Aerospace? So we did, as you rightly pointed, on the defense side of our business. See. Well, the weakness that you pointed out we saw on the commercial side. We have some transitions ongoing with production moving from Monrovia to Coxsackie,. And so some demand with the Bell Helicopter, some issues with materials on Sikorsky platforms, which drove temporary softness in the quarter on commercial helicopter. But we are going to see the Apache production here ramp up, which should be really a positive in Q2 and beyond on the rotorcraft side for us. Yeah, plus Mike, we're on the Apache engine with MagSeal. So that's also. They're going great with the engine business there. So that's a part of that lift. But you know, we might have this and that with blades right now, but now we're just starting to get ramped up. We cut the blades, Boeing looked at them, everything's looking great. We got everybody trained out in New York. So we're hoping, you know, obviously these are high energy parts, you got to be careful. But you know, we're hoping in May we're going to start really ramping up and we got the orders, we just got to get the production in place. Okay, thank you. I just end with the Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) increase in Q1, is that anything structural or contractual that changed or should we look for those Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)s to come back down? Thank you, that's a good point. So we did have just some seasonality in the sales in Q1. We had slightly bigger March. We had some items that went out towards the end of the quarter that drove it. But there isn't any structural change. It was just the seasonality, a one time kind of thing during the quarter. All right, thank you. Yeah, Mike, thanks. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Yeah. Hi, good morning. Steven Suman. I wanted to ask first on the M&A pipeline, you obviously have placeholder for M&A contribution. As we think about Vision 2027, it's been quite recently on the deal front. Are you still tracking towards the placeholder you've got in place for 27 from M& A? And maybe can you give any more detail on how the pipeline looks now and due diligence efforts and maybe expectations for M&A this year. So we. Ken, thank you for the question and good morning to you as well. We continue to track multiple opportunities in our pipeline and, you know, we've got to be disciplined and make sure we execute on the right one. We see enough in the pipeline for us to feel fairly confident in being able to get a deal done this year. And I think that's, that's what. Yeah, I would say the deal volume is good.. You know, we just, we just looked at something fairly hard and did a lot of, put a lot of hours in on it and turned out it just wasn't for us. So we're, we're involved in diligence, as you asked, and we're looking forward to getting one sooner than later. Ken. Okay, that's helpful. And are you seeing more in aerospace or defense or combined or anything? Maybe we should just keep in mind. I would say the businesses that we look at tend to be niche engineered product businesses, which often will span across some defense platforms as well as commercial aerospace. So there is a mix of both. It isn't necessarily skewed one way or the other. Yeah, I would say that's right, Ken. I'd say we usually have sort of a mix. It's usually never, you know, 100% one way or the other. So that's, that's sort of what we're seeing and what we've seen. Okay. And just finally, you seem to be running ahead of your 27 targets in terms of contribution from the engineered products. And if you do another deal this year, I'm assuming it would be, you know, very focused on the engineered products. How should we think about the, maybe the margin contribution from these engineered products? You talk obviously a lot about the sales contribution to maybe help us understand how impactful this could be as you grow that mix to the ebitda. I mean, I can imagine it's been a big component of obviously just the margin improvement on the gross margins and ebitda. But any help you can give in framing that as we think moving forward on the engineered products would be nice. Thank you. Great question, Ken. And these are significantly accretive to our margins. Right. These are engineered proprietary product businesses with access to the aftermarket and in line with some of the other aftermarket peers that you, that you covered. Right. Margins are in line with those, so they tend to be accretive. They tend to provide also significant margin Runway for us to execute on post Acquisition. And so we believe that this is going to continue to be, as we do, additional acquisitions, a key driver of margin expansion for us into 2027. Yeah, Kel, also we have, you know, as far as the value we provide for these products, I mean, we have very good pricing power. So that's the other thing which is important for investors to know. Great. Thanks, Steve. Thanks, Jamon. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Chermoli with Truist Securities. Your line is now open. Hey, morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Really nice margins here. Maybe Steve or Suman just to kind of level set us and unpack maybe the revenue guidance for the rest of the year. Mid single digit growth Defense obviously had a really strong, strong quarter here, but the comps do get a bit tougher and you're obviously going to have some of this recovery in Commercial Aero. But maybe how are you thinking about the growth rates between commercial Arrow and Defense for the remainder of the year? Yeah, let me jump in there first. I think first thing, Mike, just to note, this is a real benefit for shareholders that we have this mix of defense and commercial. Right. We've had a lot of peer groups that or peers that, you know, have more commercial and they're struggling a bit. But as you can see, our defense business we've been talking about really came to the, came to the fore, as they say in Q1. So first of all, we're really pleased with our balance as far as what I can see. Obviously we're flattish in Q2, but we feel very good about destocking and, and commercial rates going up not only on the 737 Max, but on the 787 Dreamliner. Right. Because we have a very good content mix there. So very positive on the back half. And I think maybe defense going forward, maybe not 15, but certainly a very respectable growth number. Suman. The only thing I'd add there, Steve, is that we're going to see the ramp up in the programs that have been transitioning. Right. So we have the, the TOW missile cases,, spoilers and the Tomahawk program. So across commercial and defense, we're going to get some lift in the back half from those programs coming back online. Yeah. Which is going to be great for everyone. Okay, got it. What about the A220? You know, I know Airbus commentary around both the 220 and 350 have been a little bit squishy just given the Spirit facilities. Do you expect that to be a material contributor to the A220 this year? Look, you know. Yeah. So a Couple of things. First, you know that a220 program's been great for us. As we talked about, we make the, you know, the fuselage skins, we're a supplier into China. Haven't seen any headwind yet. So we feel very good about that. So that's going to continue. We feel, you know, as far as where we sit here today, it's going to again be good business this year leading to next year. Understand about the Spirit issue and the engine issue and you know, I'm hoping sooner or later they're going to work through that. But you know, we're running rates higher than what they're shipping, that's for sure. And we're happy about that. The other thing is on the A350, we're really, we're not a player on the A350. So I know they're struggling. It won't impact us. Got it, Got it. And last one for me, I think you called out the in-flight entertainment side of commercial as being weak. I was just wondering if you could potentially size that business. What are the thoughts there? Just given that that's maybe viewed as more discretionary spending from the airlines, does that continue to be a headwind for the remainder of the year or was that just kind of short term here, temporary. That it's not a huge portion of our business. It's low single digit percentage of our total business. I think we'll continue to see some softness there for the rest of this year that we expect will be offset by other things in the portfolio. Mike, I think the compares get a little bit easier. We had a really good Q1 20, 24 with inflight, you know what I mean? That's one customer, so. And obviously we didn't have a great rest of the year. Things kind of tamped out a bit. So I think going forward we'll probably moderate around that. Got it. Okay, perfect. Thanks guys. I'll jump back in the queue. See you this week. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is now open. Hey, good morning, everybody. Steve, I wonder if you could just. Spend a few minutes talking about. The. Potential for new work scopes for you all and maybe start with the commercial side. Obviously Spirit AeroSystems is going through a thing here and I'm just wondering if there won't be some more opportunities there for you as those assets land in different hands. So is there opportunity here either at Boeing or Airbus as a result of what's going on at Spirit AeroSystems for You guys, that'd be the first part. Yeah. And then the second part would be on the defense. I'm just kind of curious if you are beginning to see any signs of increased outsourcing initiatives by any of the large-cap defense companies. Thanks. Okay, thanks. Certainly. It's funny you asked that. We have our senior VP out at Spirit actually today meeting with them in Wichita. So, you know, we have very close relationship with Spirit. They're obviously a top customer of ours and we do see more opportunity, especially as things ramp up. Okay, so for instance, we just got going on a 737 Max skins. And you know, that's early on. Right. So we do four or five skins and we do 15 a month. That's the deal we have. Right. So it's not paid by the drink. And, you know, we feel very good about, you know, increasing business there. We understand there's delivery challenges. We're pretty much 100% on time. We're pretty close to both Airbus and Spirit, Boeing, and Airbus. So our operations are very strong. So we think there is growth there. You know, we're continuing to work with them. I think the skins is sort of in the lead as well as maybe some other things. And as well as Airbus, we're getting quoted heavily by Airbus, frankly, because some of the other suppliers are not getting the job done. You know, whether that. Whether that changes hands, we'll have to see. But you know, we see a lot of growth activity as far as quoting at this point. So I think that's, I think, a good story. I think if you look at our just percentage of what we have on the programs in general and our operation performance, it's all very positive. You want to add on the second. Part or on the defense side? I think we are continuing to see numerous opportunities to bid for work. RTX is a big customer for us, our biggest customer. And we are actively bidding both a lot of new work with them. So I think stay tuned for additional wins for us there on the defense side as well. Yeah, the other thing I'd say as well, Jason, is that look especially like on card businesses, CCAs, those type of things on very difficult applications. I mean, you know, we're really good. Right. So, you know, we picked up a lot from RTX that used to make, you know, these cards in Massachusetts. And, you know, now that's coming our way in Tulsa and we have other things we're working on with Northrop. So, you know, that's not changing. And I've been bullish on defense. I've Been telling investors, look, you know, these things take time and they do, because when you're moving something from an internal operation at RTX to Tulsa, they're not going to give you everything at first. You're going to get 50%, you got to get testing machines. So all this is going to come together for us, I believe, in this year and next year. So I was very happy with the 15%. I'll say that in defense of the score. Yeah, good enough. All right, thanks, guys. Thanks, Susan. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tony Bancroft with Gamco Investors Inc. Your line is now open. Hey, good morning, gents. Congratulations. Well done. You know, based on the $1 trillion President's Budget Request (PBR), we sort of talked about this a little bit, but you know, and then on top of that, as sort of a two prong attack here, and then the increase in European defense spending, maybe you could talk a little bit more detail about how you see yourselves being positioned for that growth trajectory and maybe a little further out, you know, there have been questions of being able to continue that growth. How do you see this may be playing out over the next few years and what programs that you're on that are going to have the best exposure to the thrill? Yeah, Tony, I'll jump in. And then you came in. So, Tony, I think first, you know, and good afternoon. I think just in general, our whole sort of portfolio around, you know, electronic warfare, missiles, radar, and obviously, you know, things are going to be happening with the Iron Dome and some other things we're still trying to figure out. You know, we really feel, you know, very good and strong about being a part of this, you know, trillion dollar budget, being able to support, you know, all these customers. I mentioned in my remarks that, you know, we've in the past, right or wrongly, we were a big Raytheon house, as they would say. And now we're moving in much more to Northrop. We're moving into BAE Systems,. You know, we're moving into some of these other companies on purpose, right, to kind of build out this customer base. And we got a lot of things to provide cablesling. We're great at that, we're great at cards. So, you know, we think that we're in the right position. And you know, as I mentioned earlier, you know, not only the budget, but also customers like Raytheon Technologies (RTX) are offloading, right? They're offloading the driving margins. They might be three or four years into a program with seven year fixed pricing and they have nowhere to go. So they're going to move stuff out and they're going to try to drive margins that way as a company. So it's all looking good. Tony, nice job positioning yourself. Reach out to you Banks, thanks very much. Good to hear from you. Thank you. As a reminder to ask a question, you will need to press star 11 on your telephone. Our next question comes from the line of Noah Papanak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Hey, guys. Hi, Noah. Good afternoon. Just kind of thinking through the pace of growth through the rest of the year. I think you had last quarter talked about 1Q being flat, 2Q a little better. The 1Q actual is a little better. Still feel the same about 2Q or is that looking better? And I guess, you know, the defense growth rate's quite high in the quarter. As others have noted, the compares get a little tougher there through the rest of the year, but not that much tougher. And Aero is just down significantly in the first quarter. And you know, Boeing was on strike and had things turned off or I guess was coming out of the strike. So I don't know, maybe I'm splitting hairs on the mid single for the full year, but it's a little tough to get there. I guess if things break the right way, maybe it's just early in the year and it's a dynamic macro and you're being conservative. But how do you see the growth rate playing out through the year and what's the upside of where things could land? Hello. Good afternoon. So great question. On the commercial aerospace side, I would say that so if you look at Boeing and airbus, they're about 50% of our total commercial aerospace business. So we do expect that to ramp up in the second half of the year. But I wouldn't apply that growth rate on our entire commercial aerospace revenue. Right. So 50%. The other 50%. The other 50% includes business jets and rotorcraft and other things. But there will be growth there. There will be continued strength in the defense business, as Steve mentioned earlier, may not be at the 1520, but we do expect based on the programs and the visibility we have the rest of the year, there's going to be continued strength there. And then we have also the ramp up on the programs that have moved from one facility to another and are currently kind of in hibernation but expected to ramp up in the second half of the year. They include tow missile case, they include the spoilers in the 737 Max as well as the Tomahawk harnesses, along with the Apache blade,. So those are all expected to give us Some lift in the second half. So we see good growth in commercial aerospace, good growth in defense to kind of get us to that mid single digit number for the full year. Yeah, no, I'd also say look, you know, we're okay. Is it a little conservative right now? Yeah, we want to really see how the second quarter goes with BA and Spirit. Obviously that's a big part of our growth story. So we'll probably have a firmer number. We will, you know, the next call. But that's, that's kind of where we see it right now. Okay, that makes sense. Where do you expect your mix of revenue from engineered systems to be as you're exiting the year? It will kind of depend on the acquisition. I think if we do get an acquisition, it likely to exceed or get very close to kind of the 25% again, depends on the timing also of the acquisition and how much of revenues are contributed. But we expect it to be in that 23% to 24% likely this year. And with an acquisition ramping up to beyond 25% in the next 12 months. Yeah, I think that's right. I think we're going to. We're obviously job one right now is another acquisition. Right. So everybody's working hard on that. So once we do that, we think we'll be over that. And then, you know, come next year we'll have new thoughts about, you know, the next five years. Right. So what we're holding right now with Division 2027 and you know, we're happy where we are. Okay. Should we expect the first quarter segment operating margin to be the low watermark for the year and you work higher sequentially off of it or is there seasonality or expense, timing or mix that could drive a lower quarter at some point in the year. So I would say there is some goodness in the Q1 margin. So at 15.9% EBITDA margin, we are also. And if you linearly space out our Vision 2027 goal, we would need to be at 16% by the end of the year. So we kind of are there already in Q1, but it does have 50 to 75 basis points of I would say mix goodness in it. So, you know, we'll continue to see, I think good margins for the rest of the year. But I wouldn't say this is a low watermark. But you know, with that 50 to 75 basis points range, I think we're. Is how I would say, yeah, round 16 should be good, right? Yeah, to the end of the year makes sense. And Then just last one Suman, what are you expecting for full year 2025 free cash conversion, whether from your adjusted net Income or EBITDA. So we did. We had 40% free cash flow conversion last year. In 2024, we had a little over 30% free cash flow conversion in 2023. We expect 2025 to be continuing that path of improvement. I wouldn't guide to a specific number for the year. We don't typically provide free cash flow guidance. Our end goal here over the next few years is to get back to 100% free cash flow as a percentage of adjusted net income. But that will happen over the next couple of years as we unwind our working capital investments. That would be better this year, but. It will be better this year than. It was continuing that, continuing that trajectory. Okay, thank you so much. Thanks, Noah. Thanks for joining us. Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Steve Oswald for closing remarks. Okay, just wrapping up here. Thank you again for joining us for the call. Again, just to reiterate, you know, we feel great about our start this year. We appreciate the thoughtful questions, the support from our shareholders. I feel very optimistic about this year and next year. And we look forward to reconnecting after Q2. Have a very good day and a safe day. Thank you. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now.","transcript_id":"1a7321f9-f7cd-48b7-ba97-a4268ec22e9d","type":"NON_LIVE"}],"updated_at":"2025-05-06T18:02:45.018869Z"},{"audio":{"content_type":"audio/mpeg","quality":"192kbps","url":"https://cdn.kscope.io/ks-trsc-6247de8bc2b0f876d43ef04.mp3?key=0168e3f5-cb74-4278-8437-b3db550908bb"},"call_id":"6247de8bc2b0f876d43ef04","call_title":"Ducommune reports strong Q4 growth, advances Vision 2027 strategy amid market challenges","created_at":"2025-02-27T19:06:12Z","description":"","duration":48,"end_time":"2025-02-27T19:54:12Z","exchange":"ALL","figis":["BBG001S5QDZ0"],"headline":"Ducommune posts 2.6% Q4 revenue growth, driven by defense and aerospace, while guiding for mid-single digit growth in 2025 amid ongoing challenges.","language":"en","name":"","participants":[{"call_id":"6247de8bc2b0f876d43ef04","human_verified":false,"mentions":1,"name":"Sam Sa","organization":"","participant_id":"dc8bca13-fa11-4f5d-b2d4-9cc8f39d76c0","role":"Unknown"},{"call_id":"6247de8bc2b0f876d43ef04","human_verified":false,"mentions":1,"name":"Jeremy","organization":"","participant_id":"f6f8064c-6809-4eba-9af5-760000fadcf5","role":"Unknown"},{"call_id":"6247de8bc2b0f876d43ef04","human_verified":false,"mentions":1,"name":"Michael Cirmoli","organization":"","participant_id":"c744158e-628d-4d8d-b95c-547282381e1e","role":"Unknown"},{"call_id":"6247de8bc2b0f876d43ef04","human_verified":false,"mentions":2,"name":"Alexandra Mandery","organization":"","participant_id":"421159c6-3e10-4ea5-b3e1-bdbc8358685e","role":"Unknown"},{"call_id":"6247de8bc2b0f876d43ef04","human_verified":false,"mentions":3,"name":"Noah Popinac","organization":"","participant_id":"de0815be-fdee-4d89-9338-9815c0b348b6","role":"Equity Analyst at Goldman Sachs"},{"call_id":"6247de8bc2b0f876d43ef04","human_verified":false,"mentions":1,"name":"Jason Girthy","organization":"","participant_id":"e3a42b52-dc12-4efa-b478-4f97551263a5","role":"Unknown"},{"call_id":"6247de8bc2b0f876d43ef04","human_verified":false,"mentions":2,"name":"Mike Crawford","organization":"","participant_id":"26fc26fa-fb6b-42e9-8887-fb70f48ee954","role":"Equity Analyst at B.

Thanks everyone for joining us today for our fourth quarter conference call today and as usual I will give an update of the current situation at the Company. Afterwards Simone will review our financials in detail. Let me start off again on this quarterly call with the Ducommun's Vision 2027 game plan for investors. The strategy and vision were developed coming out of the COVID pandemic over the summer and fall of 2022 unanimously approved by the board, the Common Board, in November 2022 and then presented to investors the following month in New York, where we got excellent feedback. Since that time, Ducommun's Management has been executing the Vision 2027 strategy by increasing the revenue percentage of engineered product and aftermarket content which finished at 23% for 2024, up from 19% in 2023 Consolidating our rooftop footprint in contract manufacturing continuing the targeted acquisition program executing our offloading strategy with Defense Primes and high growth segments of the defense budget, driving value added pricing and expanding content on key commercial aerospace platforms. All of us here, as well as my fellow board members continue to have a high conviction in the Vision 2027 strategy and financial goals and believe the many catalysts ahead present a unique value creation opportunity for shareholders. The Q4 2024 results are another example of our strategy initiatives working with much more to come in the next few years. Q4 was our 15th consecutive quarter with year over year growth in revenue growing 2.6% over prior year to 1 97.3 million. Despite significant headwinds in commercial aerospace build rates, destocking at Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems, and the strategic pruning of our non core industrial business which I've mentioned in the past. It was also our sixth consecutive quarter above $190 million in revenue. Strong growth in our missile and electronic warfare programs, F16 and military ground vehicle programs drove our military and space revenue to 5% growth over prior year. The defense business has now been over $100 million in revenues for the fifth time in the last six quarters and remain optimistic about the growth ahead. I also want to point out that three of our top five customers in Q4 were defense primes and that is consistent with all the quarters in 2024. There's great momentum as we move to build scale at other defense primes such as Northrop Grumman outside of rtx, our largest customer. Also on the defense side, obviously a lot of discussion going on for European defense budgets. On January 6th we put out a press release and did announce a major order in Q4 from Bayern Chemi, a new customer for DCO based in Germany and is 100% owned by MDBoeing. This order is in support of NATO and the Patriot PAC 2 missile. Bayern Kemi makes the rocket motor and came to DCO in Joplin, Missouri for Best in World Cabling Solutions. All POS were received in Q4 which totaled over $40 million in cable assemblies and shipments will begin in 2025 through 2030. We're obviously thrilled with this new customer and expect more activity with FMS in 2025. We are very well positioned in our commercial aerospace business. We continue to see excellent growth on the A220 program where we make the skins for the entire fuselage. The A220 program grew more than 40% during Q4 and we continue to see growth on other Airbus platforms as well. The commercial rotorcraft business grew over 50% in Q4 over prior year with strong growth on the S92 platform as well as our BLR Aerospace FastFin business for helicopters, DCO's most recent acquisition. This growth was partially offset by weakness on Boeing platforms that we all know as they slowly resume production after the strike in Q4. Overall commercial aerospace grew 4% year over year in the quarter and we have now grown year over year revenue on commercial aerospace business for 14 consecutive quarters. This is a great story showing the resilience of our business even in a challenging environment with Spirit and Boeing. Gross Margins also grew 4.7 million to 23.5% in Q4, up 180 basis points year over year from 21.7%. So we continue to realize year over year benefits from our strategic value pricing initiatives, productivity improvements, growing the Engineered Products portfolio with aftermarket and initial restructuring savings partially offset by some unfavorable product mix and one time expenses during the quarter. Our Monrovia, California facility is now closed and our Berryville, Arkansas, facility is down to less than 10 people to maintain capability until the receiving plant in Guaymas,, Mexico is certified for the Tomahawk missile program that is expected very soon. We are already seeing cost savings for these facility closures. We'll see those savings be higher as the receiving plants ramp up production in 2025. Stay tuned for adjusted operating income margins. In Q4 the team delivered 8.2% which is about flat to the prior year of 8.3%. We continue to be pleased with the growth in our engineered product businesses and are encouraged by the performance in our electronic business this quarter resulting from from the impact of our strategic pricing initiatives. Our restructuring savings during the quarter were offset by lower margins in our structures business due to unfavorable mix and one time expenses. Adjusted EBITDA continues to grow compared to last year at 13.8% up 4.3 million and exceeding 27 million. Great to see. This represents an expansion of 180 basis points above prior year. This continues our year over year momentum. We've seen each quarter in 2024 as we work towards the 18% goal. In our Vision 2027 plan, GAAP diluted EPS was $0.45 a share in Q4 2024 versus $0.34 a share for Q4 2023 and with the adjustments, diluted EPS was a solid $0.75 a share compared to the diluted EPS of $0.70 in the prior year quarter. The higher gap in adjusted diluted EPS during the quarter was driven by improved operating income as well as lower interest costs due to our proactive hedging strategy which took effect in January 2024. The company's consolidated backlog continues to be strong at 1.06 billion, increasing 17 million sequentially and over 67 million year over year despite headwind from VA. The defense backlog increased 98 million compared to the prior year quarter and is now at 625 million with new orders from previously discussed Bayern, Chemi, the Toll missile case, Mesa Airborne Surveillance as well as other platforms. As discussed, we experienced a pause in the order cycle for the Toll missile case, but now we're coming back strong with better pricing. We manufactured in our Guaymas,, Mexico facility where previously was produced in Monrovia, California. The commercial aerospace backlog decreased sequentially by $14 million full year 2024 revenue grew 3.9% to a record 786 million. Our commercial aerospace business grew 8% in 2024 with strength in Airbus commercial rotorcraft and business jet platforms, partially offset by weakness on Boeing platforms. Our military and space business grew 4% in 2024 driven by strong performance across missiles, missile defense, radar, naval and F15 programs, partially offset by weakness on the F18 and F35 programs. Our non core industrial businesses was down 24% as well in 2024 as we continue to selectively prune non core business to refocus our portfolio for the long term. Full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 140 basis points to 14.8%, an excellent performance as we make steady progress towards our Vision 2027 target of 18% EBITDA margins. I'm also delighted to share significant progress on what I believe is the number one strategic goal under our Vision 2027 strategy. In December 2022, we set a target of generating 25% plus of our revenues from engineered products, up from 9% in 2017 and 15% in 2022. In 2024, engineered product revenue was 23% of our total revenue, up from 19% in 2023, positioning us well ahead of the curve achieving our Vision 2027 goal and we're pushing for a lot more. We achieved this both through focused investment, driving organic growth on our current businesses as well as the BLR acquisition. This is tremendous progress and I could not be happier. As for 2025 revenue, we are positioned to benefit from the expected bone recovery as the year progresses as well as the upcoming certification of three major revenue programs being transferred from our closed plants. We are guiding to mid single digit growth for the year with a flattish first quarter due to destocking and lower build rates, slightly better revenue in Q2 and then renewed strength in the second half of 2025. Now let me provide some additional color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we saw revenues of 109 million compared to 104 million in Q4. 2023 growth was driven by missile programs such as the Mir, the Tow Circuit cards along with Next Generation jammer and the F16. These are partially offset by weakness on the F35 Apache and the well documented F18. Fourth quarter military space revenue represented 55% of Ducomma's revenue in the period, down from 59% for the full year back in 2022 and 70% in 2021. We expected this trend and reflects commercial aerospace getting stronger for DCO providing good balance. We also ended the fourth quarter with a backlog of 625 million, an increase of 98 million year over year representing 59% of DUCommens total backlog within our Commercial Aerospace operations. Fourth quarter revenue continued to grow increasing 4% year over year to 40 80. Excuse me, 82 million driven mainly by growth on the A220 and S92 platforms, offset by lower rates on the MAX. As mentioned earlier, we believe a much better story is ahead for Boeing and the MAX now that production is ramping up again. We also have high confidence in Kelly Ortberg and his team. The backlog within our commercial aerospace business was 416 million at the end of the fourth quarter, decreasing 15 million compared to the prior year driven by Boeing. By the Boeing strike, we expect this to recover as production rates ramp up in 2025. Revenues in our industrial business declined by a third to $6 million during Q4 as we continue to strategically prune non core business from the portfolio. This will benefit the company in the longer term as we transition that capacity to our core aerospace and defense platforms. Okay, with that I'll have Suman review our financial results in detail."},{"end_time":"1495130","segment_id":2,"speaker":"Suman","start_time":"930520","text":"Suman thank you Steve. As a reminder, please see the company's 10K and fourth quarter earnings release for a further description of information mentioned on today's call. As Steve discussed, our fourth quarter results reflected another period of solid performance with growth in both our commercial aerospace and military end markets. We also continued to make good progress on our facility consolidation projects which are now nearing completion and will drive further synergies in late 2025 and into 2026 as we close out the recertification of the various product lines at the receiving facilities over the next few months. As Steve highlighted earlier, we also made great progress in continuing to build up our engineered product portfolio with those revenues now contributing 23% to our mix. These actions, along with our strategic pricing initiatives drove strong margin expansion in 2024 and has put us on a strong footing to achieve our Vision 2027 goals. Now turning to our fourth quarter results, revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024 was 197.3 million versus 192.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. The year over year increase of 2.6% reflects growth in both commercial aerospace and military in space, highlighted by 5.1 million of growth across military and space platforms and 3 million of growth in our commercial aerospace platforms. We posted total gross profit of 46.4 million or 23.5% of revenue for the quarter versus 41.7 million or 21.7% of revenue in the prior year period. We continue to provide adjusted gross margins as we have certain non GAAP cost of sales items in the current and prior period relating to inventory, step up amortization on our recent acquisitions and and restructuring charges. On an adjusted basis, our gross margins were 24% in Q4 2024 versus 23.2% in Q4 2023,. The improvement in gross margin was driven by our growing engineered products portfolio, strategic pricing initiatives, productivity improvements and restructuring savings partially offset by unfavorable product mix in our structured segment and one time expenses. We continue to make progress working through a difficult operating environment with supply chain and labor. Through our proactive efforts including strategic buys and our inventory investments, we have been able to avoid any significant impacts thus far on our business. Going forward, we will continue to work to improve the working capital returns in the business and improve our cash flow. The common reported operating income for Q4 2024 of 10.4 million or 5.3% of revenue compared to 8.9 million or 4.6% of revenue in the prior year period. Adjusted operating income was 16.1 million or 8.2% of revenue this quarter compared to 15.9 million or 8.3% of revenue. In the comparable period last year, the Company reported net income for the fourth quarter of 2024 of 6.8 million or $0.45 per diluted share, compared to 5.1 million or $0.34 per diluted share a year ago. On an adjusted basis, the Company reported net income of 11.4 million or $0.75 per diluted share compared to adjusted net income of 10.4 million or $0.70 in Q4 2023,. The higher net income and adjusted net income during the quarter was driven by the higher operating income and adjusted operating income. Additionally, our interest rate hedge helped to reduce our year over year interest expense. Now let me turn to our segment results. Our structural systems segment posted revenue of 90.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 versus 85.6 million last year. The year over year increase reflected 6.4 million of fire sales across our commercial aerospace applications including the A220 and S92 rotorcraft platform. Military and space applications were down 5%, driven primarily by a decline in Apache revenue as we shut down production in our Monrovia facility, partially offset by growth in Black Hawk and other military vehicles. Structural systems operating income for the quarter was 3.2 million or 3.6% of revenue compared to 6.6 million or 7.7% of revenue for the prior year quarter. Excluding restructuring charges and other adjustments in both years, the segment operating margin was 9.2% in Q4 2024 versus 14.6% in Q4 2023,. The decline in margin during the quarter was driven by unfavorable program mix and higher one time costs. Our electronic system segment posted revenue of 107 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 versus 106.7 million in the prior year period. Higher revenues from the Mir, Next generation jammer and F16 platforms were offset by lower revenues from In Flight Entertainment Electronics along with a reduction in our industrials business as we chose to selectively prune non core work electronic systems operating income for the fourth quarter was 19 million or 17.7% of revenue versus 9.8 million or 9.2% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding restructuring charges and other adjustments in both years, the segment operating margin was 17.7% in Q4 2024 versus 10.2% in Q4 2023,. The year over year increase was primarily due to a higher mix of engineered products, strategic value pricing initiatives as well as savings from the restructuring program. The restructuring savings were driven by the consolidation of product lines from our variable performance center into our job plan facility. Next, I would like to provide an update on our ongoing restructuring program. As a reminder and as discussed previously, we commenced a restructuring initiative back in 2022. These actions are being taken to better position the company for stronger performance in the short and long term. This includes the shutdown of our facilities in Monrovia, California and Berryville, Arkansas and the transfer of that work to our low cost operation in Guaymas, Mexico and to other existing performance centers in the United States. We continue to make progress on these transitions and are working diligently with our customers Boeing and RTX to obtain the requisite approvals which are expected to be completed over the next few months. During Q4 2024, we recorded 2.3 million in restructuring charges. We expect to incur an additional 1 to 1.5 million in restructuring expenses as we complete the program. Upon the completion of our restructuring program, we expect to generate 11 to 13 million in annual savings from our actions and have already seen some realizations of savings from these actions in 2024. We expect the synergies to ramp up in late 2025 and into 2026 as the product recertification is complete and the receiving facilities move up the learning curve and ramp up production. We also anticipate selling the land and buildings at both Monrovia, California and Berryville, Arkansas. Turning next to liquidity and capital resources in 2024 we generated $34.2 million in cash flow from operating activities, which was an improvement compared to 31.1 million in 2023. The improvement was due to net income growth of $15.6 million offset by investments in working capital. We paid down $15 million on our revolver and $7.8 million on our term loan for a total of $22.8 million during the year. As of the end of the fourth quarter, we had available liquidity of 228 million comprising of the unutilized portion of our revolver and cash on hand. Our existing credit facility was put in place in July 22 at an opportune time in the credit markets, allowing us to reduce our spread, increase the size of our revolver, and allowing us flexibility to execute on our acquisition strategy. Interest expense in Q4 2024 was 3.6 million compared to 5.4 million in Q4 2023,. The year over year improvement in interest cost was mainly due to our interest rate hedge. In November 2021 we put in place an interest rate hedge that went into effect for a seven year period starting January 2024 and pegs the one month term SOFR at 170 basis points for $150 million of our debt. The hedge resulted in interest Savings of approximately 1.8 million in Q4 2024 and will continue to drive significant interest cost savings in 2025 and beyond. To conclude the financial overview for Q4 2024, I would like to say that the fourth quarter results continued our momentum this year and positions us well for 2025 and beyond. I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks."},{"end_time":"1567640","segment_id":3,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"1495290","text":"Okay, thanks Shimon. Just in closing, Q4 was another very good quarter for DCO to finish. I believe an excellent year. In 2024 we achieved record revenues with record margin expansion and the Vision 2027 strategy in its second year really kicked in. We also delivered full year EBITDA margins of 14.8% which was an expansion of 140 basis points during the year. Solid progress towards our target we've been mentioning this morning of 18% by 2027. We also discussed our Vision 2027 target of the very important 25% plus of engineered product revenues. And 2024 coming in at 23% was terrific news. Finally, with the BEA strike now behind us, commercial bill rates heading higher along with I believe a very good defense backdrop for DCO including fms. I feel great about what lies ahead in the next few years for us, our shareholders and our other stakeholders. So with that, let's go to questions.

Yeah, maybe just to kick off, appreciate the 2025 mid single digit top line outlook as we think about the year. Specifically, can you provide any color on expectations for defense and commercial markets, commercial aerospace and then I guess within commercial aerospace, where are you shipping today on. On maybe the max where I guess, what do you see as continued destocking risk on that particular program into the first part of here of 2025?"},{"end_time":"1739100","segment_id":10,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"1632450","text":"Yeah. All right, Ken, thanks for the question. First, let me, let me just tackle the commercial part. I mean, you know, a big part of our MAX business is through Spirit. Right. So, you know, that's a large part of our shipments, including what we sent to Boeing as well. Lesser. So, you know, we think that everything we're hearing is that first, the first quarter and probably through the first half, you know, there's certainly destocking headwinds in Spirit. Okay. So, you know, I can't tell you exactly what. But, you know, that's why we feel like, you know, first half of the year is first quarter. Especially the first half of the year is a bit challenging on the destocking. I think after that, things will open up a bit. Really. All indications are that they're going to get to the mid-30s, at least we're hoping, and we think that's in the cards now. So we think the second half's going to be better than the first. Our military side, I mean, I know the services companies and lots of other folks are seeing tremendous headwinds. I mean, you know, I can only talk to our backlog. Our backlog is real good. We're on these programs that we like. I mean, and I mentioned this new customer, Ken, who, you know, it's just one of many, but, you know, this whole NATO buy that we got in Q4 that, you know, just because we're good at cabling, really good, and, you know, we've been working with Raytheon in the past, we were able to get that, that order. So I feel good about defense. I think that, you know, we're going to write up more commercial arrow in the second half of the year. First half destocking and sort of still moving bill rates higher, I think, is the story for dco."},{"end_time":"1741500","segment_id":11,"speaker":"Ken Herbert","start_time":"1741100","text":"Okay."},{"end_time":"1763210","segment_id":12,"speaker":"Suman","start_time":"1741500","text":"So if I had to, we are seeing improvement between January and February this year in our shipments both to Spirit and Boeing. So we have seen a ramp up and from the teens into the 20s, both with Boeing and Spirit going from January to February. So that bodes well for Q1 and the rest of 2025."},{"end_time":"1765850","segment_id":13,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"1763370","text":"This spirit has a lot of fuselages, as you know, Ken."},{"end_time":"1782960","segment_id":14,"speaker":"Ken Herbert","start_time":"1766490","text":"Yeah, yeah, no, I appreciate that. So if I think about again, relative to the mid single digit, maybe upper end of that range in defense and lower end of that range or better growth in defense, I guess, in military and space in 25 relative to commercial. Is that the right way to think about it?"},{"end_time":"1793760","segment_id":15,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"1785520","text":"I think we're going to see, we are expecting to see good growth in commercial as well, but it's going to be more back half.

Yeah, that's a good question. You know, this whole order we got, this 40 million plus order is frankly one of our first. Okay, so we are getting lift with the Polish order for the Apache helicopters and those type of things. We get big lift from that, but that goes through our US Defense primes. This is a new thing for dco, so we're hoping for more on that. It's early, but this is a direct shipment into Germany. So it's, I think it bodes well for hopefully more this year and next year."},{"end_time":"1847600","segment_id":18,"speaker":"Ken Herbert","start_time":"1845360","text":"Perfect, thanks.

I know it's a little early, but with potential offsets to defense budget spending where things are prioritized under the new administration as much as 8% targeted, you know, where does Duke Commons sit in the mix? Like, let's just take for example, growing platforms like the XM30, that is like a new next generation combat vehicle. That's probably okay, but maybe some other older platforms might get hit on re-prioritization of spending. So as you look at it now, how would you characterize your position amid all this?"},{"end_time":"1962560","segment_id":22,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"1910150","text":"Yeah, Mike, I hate to give you that answer. I'll give you two parts of the answer. First, you know, it's tough for us to know right now. So that's the first answer I'll give you. The second answer is that we feel like when we look across what we have, we feel very good about, you know, where we are with our circuit cards, with our cabling, you know, with our, you know, we've got, we're chock full of orders for Apache, even though that's. That program, as I mentioned, is offline right now and it'll be certified in the next couple months and will be made in New York at Okrasaki facility. The Tomahawk missile is going to be there, as, you know. So, you know, Spy six, you know, maybe here, maybe there. We feel like at least, you know, what we know today. We feel good about the breadth. That's what I would say about our defense business."},{"end_time":"2001870","segment_id":23,"speaker":"Suman","start_time":"1963120","text":"We don't have strong reliance on any one program. No individual program is more than 10% of our defense revenues, including programs such as the F35, the F16 or F18. So I think we're diversified in that way. And also the focus, as Steve mentioned on our missile, missile defense, electronic warfare, our focus in those strategic areas, I think is going to bode well if there is that pivot that you're talking about. And we should hopefully see further growth in those areas offsetting weakness on the more legacy platforms."},{"end_time":"2019990","segment_id":24,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"2001870","text":"The only thing, Mike, we've been riding down is the F18, which we've signaled the last, I guess, year or two on the call. Right. So we're riding that down. But the good news is, is that a lot of that lower revenue now is in the base. So, you know, we're not going to see as much headwind on that. That's our view."},{"end_time":"2061579","segment_id":25,"speaker":"Mike Crawford","start_time":"2022080","text":"Okay, thank you. And just to switch gears a little bit, so in the IFEC business, you have this great relationship with ViaSat that has just about 4,000 commercial planes in service and another 1570 planes and backlog. So that's still going to continue for a few more years. But this has been a great growth business for you in the last few years. But at what point do you start planning for capacity where that business will slow down? At some point. If it's not next year or 2027, it's going to happen at some point. So when do you start planning for that transition?"},{"end_time":"2095500","segment_id":26,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"2062139","text":"Yeah, we're actually, how about lucky and good. Right. So all that work really comes out of Appleton, Wisconsin. That's all the card work we do for viasat and they're great partners. And you know, we have next generation jammer going in there. We have lots of things that are queued up. So we actually are probably in the next year or two looking for more space. Even though, yeah, the ViaSat work will go down. We've got lots of high demand for our Appleton products. So I'd say at least from where I sit today, we're in good shape."},{"end_time":"2108170","segment_id":27,"speaker":"Mike Crawford","start_time":"2097100","text":"Okay, thank you.

But it was the right thing for us to do to protect shareholder interests and make sure that we preserve the value of the company for our existing shareholders. And so in making sure that we were properly the management and the board was properly advised in response to the offer received from Albion river, we did engage both financial advisors as well as legal advisors over the course of the year. And those are the fees that were paid to both those legal and financial advisors that advise board and management.

Thanks everyone for joining us today for our fourth quarter conference call today and as usual I will give an update of the current situation at the Company. Afterwards Simone will review our financials in detail. Let me start off again on this quarterly call with the Ducommun's Vision 2027 game plan for investors. The strategy and vision were developed coming out of the COVID pandemic over the summer and fall of 2022 unanimously approved by the board, the Common Board, in November 2022 and then presented to investors the following month in New York, where we got excellent feedback. Since that time, Ducommun's Management has been executing the Vision 2027 strategy by increasing the revenue percentage of engineered product and aftermarket content which finished at 23% for 2024, up from 19% in 2023 Consolidating our rooftop footprint in contract manufacturing continuing the targeted acquisition program executing our offloading strategy with Defense Primes and high growth segments of the defense budget, driving value added pricing and expanding content on key commercial aerospace platforms. All of us here, as well as my fellow board members continue to have a high conviction in the Vision 2027 strategy and financial goals and believe the many catalysts ahead present a unique value creation opportunity for shareholders. The Q4 2024 results are another example of our strategy initiatives working with much more to come in the next few years. Q4 was our 15th consecutive quarter with year over year growth in revenue growing 2.6% over prior year to 1 97.3 million. Despite significant headwinds in commercial aerospace build rates, destocking at Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems, and the strategic pruning of our non core industrial business which I've mentioned in the past. It was also our sixth consecutive quarter above $190 million in revenue. Strong growth in our missile and electronic warfare programs, F16 and military ground vehicle programs drove our military and space revenue to 5% growth over prior year. The defense business has now been over $100 million in revenues for the fifth time in the last six quarters and remain optimistic about the growth ahead. I also want to point out that three of our top five customers in Q4 were defense primes and that is consistent with all the quarters in 2024. There's great momentum as we move to build scale at other defense primes such as Northrop Grumman outside of rtx, our largest customer. Also on the defense side, obviously a lot of discussion going on for European defense budgets. On January 6th we put out a press release and did announce a major order in Q4 from Bayern Chemi, a new customer for DCO based in Germany and is 100% owned by MDBoeing. This order is in support of NATO and the Patriot PAC 2 missile. Bayern Kemi makes the rocket motor and came to DCO in Joplin, Missouri for Best in World Cabling Solutions. All POS were received in Q4 which totaled over $40 million in cable assemblies and shipments will begin in 2025 through 2030. We're obviously thrilled with this new customer and expect more activity with FMS in 2025. We are very well positioned in our commercial aerospace business. We continue to see excellent growth on the A220 program where we make the skins for the entire fuselage. The A220 program grew more than 40% during Q4 and we continue to see growth on other Airbus platforms as well. The commercial rotorcraft business grew over 50% in Q4 over prior year with strong growth on the S92 platform as well as our BLR Aerospace FastFin business for helicopters, DCO's most recent acquisition. This growth was partially offset by weakness on Boeing platforms that we all know as they slowly resume production after the strike in Q4. Overall commercial aerospace grew 4% year over year in the quarter and we have now grown year over year revenue on commercial aerospace business for 14 consecutive quarters. This is a great story showing the resilience of our business even in a challenging environment with Spirit and Boeing. Gross Margins also grew 4.7 million to 23.5% in Q4, up 180 basis points year over year from 21.7%. So we continue to realize year over year benefits from our strategic value pricing initiatives, productivity improvements, growing the Engineered Products portfolio with aftermarket and initial restructuring savings partially offset by some unfavorable product mix and one time expenses during the quarter. Our Monrovia, California facility is now closed and our Berryville, Arkansas, facility is down to less than 10 people to maintain capability until the receiving plant in Guaymas,, Mexico is certified for the Tomahawk missile program that is expected very soon. We are already seeing cost savings for these facility closures. We'll see those savings be higher as the receiving plants ramp up production in 2025. Stay tuned for adjusted operating income margins. In Q4 the team delivered 8.2% which is about flat to the prior year of 8.3%. We continue to be pleased with the growth in our engineered product businesses and are encouraged by the performance in our electronic business this quarter resulting from from the impact of our strategic pricing initiatives. Our restructuring savings during the quarter were offset by lower margins in our structures business due to unfavorable mix and one time expenses. Adjusted EBITDA continues to grow compared to last year at 13.8% up 4.3 million and exceeding 27 million. Great to see. This represents an expansion of 180 basis points above prior year. This continues our year over year momentum. We've seen each quarter in 2024 as we work towards the 18% goal. In our Vision 2027 plan, GAAP diluted EPS was $0.45 a share in Q4 2024 versus $0.34 a share for Q4 2023 and with the adjustments, diluted EPS was a solid $0.75 a share compared to the diluted EPS of $0.70 in the prior year quarter. The higher gap in adjusted diluted EPS during the quarter was driven by improved operating income as well as lower interest costs due to our proactive hedging strategy which took effect in January 2024. The company's consolidated backlog continues to be strong at 1.06 billion, increasing 17 million sequentially and over 67 million year over year despite headwind from VA. The defense backlog increased 98 million compared to the prior year quarter and is now at 625 million with new orders from previously discussed Bayern, Chemi, the Toll missile case, Mesa Airborne Surveillance as well as other platforms. As discussed, we experienced a pause in the order cycle for the Toll missile case, but now we're coming back strong with better pricing. We manufactured in our Guaymas,, Mexico facility where previously was produced in Monrovia, California. The commercial aerospace backlog decreased sequentially by $14 million full year 2024 revenue grew 3.9% to a record 786 million. Our commercial aerospace business grew 8% in 2024 with strength in Airbus commercial rotorcraft and business jet platforms, partially offset by weakness on Boeing platforms. Our military and space business grew 4% in 2024 driven by strong performance across missiles, missile defense, radar, naval and F15 programs, partially offset by weakness on the F18 and F35 programs. Our non core industrial businesses was down 24% as well in 2024 as we continue to selectively prune non core business to refocus our portfolio for the long term. Full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 140 basis points to 14.8%, an excellent performance as we make steady progress towards our Vision 2027 target of 18% EBITDA margins. I'm also delighted to share significant progress on what I believe is the number one strategic goal under our Vision 2027 strategy. In December 2022, we set a target of generating 25% plus of our revenues from engineered products, up from 9% in 2017 and 15% in 2022. In 2024, engineered product revenue was 23% of our total revenue, up from 19% in 2023, positioning us well ahead of the curve achieving our Vision 2027 goal and we're pushing for a lot more. We achieved this both through focused investment, driving organic growth on our current businesses as well as the BLR acquisition. This is tremendous progress and I could not be happier. As for 2025 revenue, we are positioned to benefit from the expected bone recovery as the year progresses as well as the upcoming certification of three major revenue programs being transferred from our closed plants. We are guiding to mid single digit growth for the year with a flattish first quarter due to destocking and lower build rates, slightly better revenue in Q2 and then renewed strength in the second half of 2025. Now let me provide some additional color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we saw revenues of 109 million compared to 104 million in Q4. 2023 growth was driven by missile programs such as the Mir, the Tow Circuit cards along with Next Generation jammer and the F16. These are partially offset by weakness on the F35 Apache and the well documented F18. Fourth quarter military space revenue represented 55% of Ducomma's revenue in the period, down from 59% for the full year back in 2022 and 70% in 2021. We expected this trend and reflects commercial aerospace getting stronger for DCO providing good balance. We also ended the fourth quarter with a backlog of 625 million, an increase of 98 million year over year representing 59% of DUCommens total backlog within our Commercial Aerospace operations. Fourth quarter revenue continued to grow increasing 4% year over year to 40 80. Excuse me, 82 million driven mainly by growth on the A220 and S92 platforms, offset by lower rates on the MAX. As mentioned earlier, we believe a much better story is ahead for Boeing and the MAX now that production is ramping up again. We also have high confidence in Kelly Ortberg and his team. The backlog within our commercial aerospace business was 416 million at the end of the fourth quarter, decreasing 15 million compared to the prior year driven by Boeing. By the Boeing strike, we expect this to recover as production rates ramp up in 2025. Revenues in our industrial business declined by a third to $6 million during Q4 as we continue to strategically prune non core business from the portfolio. This will benefit the company in the longer term as we transition that capacity to our core aerospace and defense platforms. Okay, with that I'll have Suman review our financial results in detail. Suman thank you Steve. As a reminder, please see the company's 10K and fourth quarter earnings release for a further description of information mentioned on today's call. As Steve discussed, our fourth quarter results reflected another period of solid performance with growth in both our commercial aerospace and military end markets. We also continued to make good progress on our facility consolidation projects which are now nearing completion and will drive further synergies in late 2025 and into 2026 as we close out the recertification of the various product lines at the receiving facilities over the next few months. As Steve highlighted earlier, we also made great progress in continuing to build up our engineered product portfolio with those revenues now contributing 23% to our mix. These actions, along with our strategic pricing initiatives drove strong margin expansion in 2024 and has put us on a strong footing to achieve our Vision 2027 goals. Now turning to our fourth quarter results, revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024 was 197.3 million versus 192.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. The year over year increase of 2.6% reflects growth in both commercial aerospace and military in space, highlighted by 5.1 million of growth across military and space platforms and 3 million of growth in our commercial aerospace platforms. We posted total gross profit of 46.4 million or 23.5% of revenue for the quarter versus 41.7 million or 21.7% of revenue in the prior year period. We continue to provide adjusted gross margins as we have certain non GAAP cost of sales items in the current and prior period relating to inventory, step up amortization on our recent acquisitions and and restructuring charges. On an adjusted basis, our gross margins were 24% in Q4 2024 versus 23.2% in Q4 2023,. The improvement in gross margin was driven by our growing engineered products portfolio, strategic pricing initiatives, productivity improvements and restructuring savings partially offset by unfavorable product mix in our structured segment and one time expenses. We continue to make progress working through a difficult operating environment with supply chain and labor. Through our proactive efforts including strategic buys and our inventory investments, we have been able to avoid any significant impacts thus far on our business. Going forward, we will continue to work to improve the working capital returns in the business and improve our cash flow. The common reported operating income for Q4 2024 of 10.4 million or 5.3% of revenue compared to 8.9 million or 4.6% of revenue in the prior year period. Adjusted operating income was 16.1 million or 8.2% of revenue this quarter compared to 15.9 million or 8.3% of revenue. In the comparable period last year, the Company reported net income for the fourth quarter of 2024 of 6.8 million or $0.45 per diluted share, compared to 5.1 million or $0.34 per diluted share a year ago. On an adjusted basis, the Company reported net income of 11.4 million or $0.75 per diluted share compared to adjusted net income of 10.4 million or $0.70 in Q4 2023,. The higher net income and adjusted net income during the quarter was driven by the higher operating income and adjusted operating income. Additionally, our interest rate hedge helped to reduce our year over year interest expense. Now let me turn to our segment results. Our structural systems segment posted revenue of 90.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 versus 85.6 million last year. The year over year increase reflected 6.4 million of fire sales across our commercial aerospace applications including the A220 and S92 rotorcraft platform. Military and space applications were down 5%, driven primarily by a decline in Apache revenue as we shut down production in our Monrovia facility, partially offset by growth in Black Hawk and other military vehicles. Structural systems operating income for the quarter was 3.2 million or 3.6% of revenue compared to 6.6 million or 7.7% of revenue for the prior year quarter. Excluding restructuring charges and other adjustments in both years, the segment operating margin was 9.2% in Q4 2024 versus 14.6% in Q4 2023,. The decline in margin during the quarter was driven by unfavorable program mix and higher one time costs. Our electronic system segment posted revenue of 107 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 versus 106.7 million in the prior year period. Higher revenues from the Mir, Next generation jammer and F16 platforms were offset by lower revenues from In Flight Entertainment Electronics along with a reduction in our industrials business as we chose to selectively prune non core work electronic systems operating income for the fourth quarter was 19 million or 17.7% of revenue versus 9.8 million or 9.2% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding restructuring charges and other adjustments in both years, the segment operating margin was 17.7% in Q4 2024 versus 10.2% in Q4 2023,. The year over year increase was primarily due to a higher mix of engineered products, strategic value pricing initiatives as well as savings from the restructuring program. The restructuring savings were driven by the consolidation of product lines from our variable performance center into our job plan facility. Next, I would like to provide an update on our ongoing restructuring program. As a reminder and as discussed previously, we commenced a restructuring initiative back in 2022. These actions are being taken to better position the company for stronger performance in the short and long term. This includes the shutdown of our facilities in Monrovia, California and Berryville, Arkansas and the transfer of that work to our low cost operation in Guaymas, Mexico and to other existing performance centers in the United States. We continue to make progress on these transitions and are working diligently with our customers Boeing and RTX to obtain the requisite approvals which are expected to be completed over the next few months. During Q4 2024, we recorded 2.3 million in restructuring charges. We expect to incur an additional 1 to 1.5 million in restructuring expenses as we complete the program. Upon the completion of our restructuring program, we expect to generate 11 to 13 million in annual savings from our actions and have already seen some realizations of savings from these actions in 2024. We expect the synergies to ramp up in late 2025 and into 2026 as the product recertification is complete and the receiving facilities move up the learning curve and ramp up production. We also anticipate selling the land and buildings at both Monrovia, California and Berryville, Arkansas. Turning next to liquidity and capital resources in 2024 we generated $34.2 million in cash flow from operating activities, which was an improvement compared to 31.1 million in 2023. The improvement was due to net income growth of $15.6 million offset by investments in working capital. We paid down $15 million on our revolver and $7.8 million on our term loan for a total of $22.8 million during the year. As of the end of the fourth quarter, we had available liquidity of 228 million comprising of the unutilized portion of our revolver and cash on hand. Our existing credit facility was put in place in July 22 at an opportune time in the credit markets, allowing us to reduce our spread, increase the size of our revolver, and allowing us flexibility to execute on our acquisition strategy. Interest expense in Q4 2024 was 3.6 million compared to 5.4 million in Q4 2023,. The year over year improvement in interest cost was mainly due to our interest rate hedge. In November 2021 we put in place an interest rate hedge that went into effect for a seven year period starting January 2024 and pegs the one month term SOFR at 170 basis points for $150 million of our debt. The hedge resulted in interest Savings of approximately 1.8 million in Q4 2024 and will continue to drive significant interest cost savings in 2025 and beyond. To conclude the financial overview for Q4 2024, I would like to say that the fourth quarter results continued our momentum this year and positions us well for 2025 and beyond. I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Okay, thanks Shimon. Just in closing, Q4 was another very good quarter for DCO to finish. I believe an excellent year. In 2024 we achieved record revenues with record margin expansion and the Vision 2027 strategy in its second year really kicked in. We also delivered full year EBITDA margins of 14.8% which was an expansion of 140 basis points during the year. Solid progress towards our target we've been mentioning this morning of 18% by 2027. We also discussed our Vision 2027 target of the very important 25% plus of engineered product revenues. And 2024 coming in at 23% was terrific news. Finally, with the BEA strike now behind us, commercial bill rates heading higher along with I believe a very good defense backdrop for DCO including fms. I feel great about what lies ahead in the next few years for us, our shareholders and our other stakeholders. So with that, let's go to questions. Thank you. Thank you. At this time we'll conduct the question and answer session as a reminder to ask a question, you'll need to press Star 11 on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press star 11 again. Please stand by while we compile the Q and A roster. And our first question comes online of Ken Herbert of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Yeah. Hey, good morning. Steven Suman. Ken, good morning. Good morning. Hey Steve. Yeah, maybe just to kick off, appreciate the 2025 mid single digit top line outlook as we think about the year. Specifically, can you provide any color on expectations for defense and commercial markets, commercial aerospace and then I guess within commercial aerospace, where are you shipping today on. On maybe the max where I guess, what do you see as continued destocking risk on that particular program into the first part of here of 2025? Yeah. All right, Ken, thanks for the question. First, let me, let me just tackle the commercial part. I mean, you know, a big part of our MAX business is through Spirit. Right. So, you know, that's a large part of our shipments, including what we sent to Boeing as well. Lesser. So, you know, we think that everything we're hearing is that first, the first quarter and probably through the first half, you know, there's certainly destocking headwinds in Spirit. Okay. So, you know, I can't tell you exactly what. But, you know, that's why we feel like, you know, first half of the year is first quarter. Especially the first half of the year is a bit challenging on the destocking. I think after that, things will open up a bit. Really. All indications are that they're going to get to the mid-30s, at least we're hoping, and we think that's in the cards now. So we think the second half's going to be better than the first. Our military side, I mean, I know the services companies and lots of other folks are seeing tremendous headwinds. I mean, you know, I can only talk to our backlog. Our backlog is real good. We're on these programs that we like. I mean, and I mentioned this new customer, Ken, who, you know, it's just one of many, but, you know, this whole NATO buy that we got in Q4 that, you know, just because we're good at cabling, really good, and, you know, we've been working with Raytheon in the past, we were able to get that, that order. So I feel good about defense. I think that, you know, we're going to write up more commercial arrow in the second half of the year. First half destocking and sort of still moving bill rates higher, I think, is the story for dco. Okay. So if I had to, we are seeing improvement between January and February this year in our shipments both to Spirit and Boeing. So we have seen a ramp up and from the teens into the 20s, both with Boeing and Spirit going from January to February. So that bodes well for Q1 and the rest of 2025. This spirit has a lot of fuselages, as you know, Ken. Yeah, yeah, no, I appreciate that. So if I think about again, relative to the mid single digit, maybe upper end of that range in defense and lower end of that range or better growth in defense, I guess, in military and space in 25 relative to commercial. Is that the right way to think about it? I think we're going to see, we are expecting to see good growth in commercial as well, but it's going to be more back half. I think defense growth is going to be more even through the year. Okay, perfect. And just A clarification. What percent of your maybe Defense sales ultimately end up in Europe and how much will you benefit just from what's expected to be a surge in defense spending? There's. Yeah, that's a good question. You know, this whole order we got, this 40 million plus order is frankly one of our first. Okay, so we are getting lift with the Polish order for the Apache helicopters and those type of things. We get big lift from that, but that goes through our US Defense primes. This is a new thing for dco, so we're hoping for more on that. It's early, but this is a direct shipment into Germany. So it's, I think it bodes well for hopefully more this year and next year. Perfect, thanks. I'll pass it back there. All right, Ken, thanks. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Crawford of B. Riley Securities. Your line is not open. Thank you. I know it's a little early, but with potential offsets to defense budget spending where things are prioritized under the new administration as much as 8% targeted, you know, where does Duke Commons sit in the mix? Like, let's just take for example, growing platforms like the XM30, that is like a new next generation combat vehicle. That's probably okay, but maybe some other older platforms might get hit on re-prioritization of spending. So as you look at it now, how would you characterize your position amid all this? Yeah, Mike, I hate to give you that answer. I'll give you two parts of the answer. First, you know, it's tough for us to know right now. So that's the first answer I'll give you. The second answer is that we feel like when we look across what we have, we feel very good about, you know, where we are with our circuit cards, with our cabling, you know, with our, you know, we've got, we're chock full of orders for Apache, even though that's. That program, as I mentioned, is offline right now and it'll be certified in the next couple months and will be made in New York at Okrasaki facility. The Tomahawk missile is going to be there, as, you know. So, you know, Spy six, you know, maybe here, maybe there. We feel like at least, you know, what we know today. We feel good about the breadth. That's what I would say about our defense business. We don't have strong reliance on any one program. No individual program is more than 10% of our defense revenues, including programs such as the F35, the F16 or F18. So I think we're diversified in that way. And also the focus, as Steve mentioned on our missile, missile defense, electronic warfare, our focus in those strategic areas, I think is going to bode well if there is that pivot that you're talking about. And we should hopefully see further growth in those areas offsetting weakness on the more legacy platforms. The only thing, Mike, we've been riding down is the F18, which we've signaled the last, I guess, year or two on the call. Right. So we're riding that down. But the good news is, is that a lot of that lower revenue now is in the base. So, you know, we're not going to see as much headwind on that. That's our view. Okay, thank you. And just to switch gears a little bit, so in the IFEC business, you have this great relationship with ViaSat that has just about 4,000 commercial planes in service and another 1570 planes and backlog. So that's still going to continue for a few more years. But this has been a great growth business for you in the last few years. But at what point do you start planning for capacity where that business will slow down? At some point. If it's not next year or 2027, it's going to happen at some point. So when do you start planning for that transition? Yeah, we're actually, how about lucky and good. Right. So all that work really comes out of Appleton, Wisconsin. That's all the card work we do for viasat and they're great partners. And you know, we have next generation jammer going in there. We have lots of things that are queued up. So we actually are probably in the next year or two looking for more space. Even though, yeah, the ViaSat work will go down. We've got lots of high demand for our Appleton products. So I'd say at least from where I sit today, we're in good shape. Okay, thank you. And just the last one is, what if anything, are you seeing that's different or interesting in your M and A pipeline? So we are continuing to work on multiple opportunities. The deal flow in the lower mid market for the engineered product businesses that we have seen has been slower in the past 12 months. But there are active things in the hopper that we continue to work on and we remain optimistic about being and confident about being able to execute our acquisition strategy and meeting the Vision 2027 goals. Thank you. Thanks, Mike. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from a line of Jason Girthy, a city Your line is now open. Hi, this is Jeremy. Jason, I'm for Jason Gursky. I just kind of wanted to understand sort of how much of the margin hit this quarter in structural systems was like mix as opposed to like costs that would fade away once Mexico is up and running. And so like if it's mixed, you know, how long does that mix sort of persist for? Right, great question. And I would say it's kind of about evenly split between mix as well as one time expenses that were specific to the quarter. And the mix as well was unusual to the quarter. And we do expect the margins in the structures business to fully recover in Q1 2025. Gotcha, gotcha. I really appreciate that. And so my follow on question is just if that's the case. So it sounds like Boeing programs are a bit more profitable than Airbus. So first of all, is that the case? And also what can you guys do to improve Airbus program profitability? I think we avoid talking about specific customer profitability or product line profitability. That being said, we ensure that we're getting paid for the value that we bring to the customer and we continue to work on opportunities with both the customers you mentioned to raise prices where it is appropriate and make sure that we are earning sufficient margin. And those actions have taken place over the last year as you have seen growth in our margins. And there are active ongoing initiatives to drive that going forward in 2025 as well. Perfect. And then one last one. Just thank you so much for this. So how much of like additional costs did you guys sort of incur in this past quarter that were not backed out like and sort of when do those potentially go away? So are you referring to the structures segment? Yes. So it's about half of the drop in margin was an account of one time expenses just for the score. Just for the score, that's right. Gotcha. Appreciate the color. I'll pass it back. Thank you. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Alexandra Mandery of True Securities. Your line is now open. Hi, this is Alexandra Mandry on for Michael Cirmoli with True Securities. Thank you for taking my question. I just had a question on the cash flow statement. It looks like there's one item titled legal fees for unsolicited non binding acquisition offer of 738k in 4Q and 3.145 million year to date. Can you just add more color on this item and what it entails? Yes. So it's not an expense. We are happy about that. We didn't want to certainly be spending shareholder money on something like this. But it was the right thing for us to do to protect shareholder interests and make sure that we preserve the value of the company for our existing shareholders. And so in making sure that we were properly the management and the board was properly advised in response to the offer received from Albion river, we did engage both financial advisors as well as legal advisors over the course of the year. And those are the fees that were paid to both those legal and financial advisors that advise board and management. Now since in Q4 and then in February of this year, we did see a 13G filing stating that Albion no longer holds a position in new common and they have sold off their entire position. So we are not expecting these expenses to continue in 2025. Okay, great. That makes a lot of sense. And I just had a quick follow up related to defense exposure and programs. So do you have any thoughts on DOGE and potential changes for the better or worse as a result of doge? Thanks. Yeah, thank you for the question. I know it's top of mind for everyone. You know, we don't really have a viewpoint right now. Again, we mentioned earlier on the call, we feel, you know, we have a wide breadth of products that we make for defense. A lot of it is electronic warfare. A lot of it is things, cards, cablings, you know, things that are important for missiles and missile defense. And, you know, we do feel good about, you know, all our programs. I mean, I did signal a year or two ago for the F18, and that's the one program which we are winding down and most of that's already in the base. So we feel good, but again, we're not. We don't have any view as yet as far as on the Doge side. We just have the DCO view. Okay, great. Awesome. Thanks. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Again, as a reminder to ask a question, you will need to press Star one one on your telephone. Our next question comes from the line of Noah Popinac of Goldman Sachs. Your line is not open. Hello, Noah, your line is now open. I think there may be a connection issue. Let's move forward. Okay, I'm showing no further questions. I'll now like turn it back to Chairman, President and CEO Stephen Oswald for closing remarks. Okay. I want to thank everyone for joining us. Very much appreciate it. Again, you know, I felt we had a very good quarter. I think we're well positioned. I know there's, you know, lots of discussion about defense right now. Again, let me reiterate finally that you know, our view is at least from our product line. We feel very good about this year, so we'll have to see. But we that's our view. We feel strongly about our Vision 2027 and look forward to speaking with you after the first quarter. So thank you again for your support and have a great and safe day. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.","transcript_id":"2635d0f3-d4d5-490f-93ab-986e7700fd58","type":"NON_LIVE"}],"updated_at":"2025-02-27T19:54:12Z"},{"audio":{},"call_id":"6a37b77e87a905623ffa243","call_title":"Ducommon posts record revenue and margin growth amid strategic restructuring","created_at":"2024-11-07T18:55:33Z","description":"","duration":39,"end_time":"2024-11-07T19:34:33Z","exchange":"NYSE","figis":["BBG001S5QDZ0"],"headline":"Ducommon achieves record Q3 revenue of $201.4 million, driven by strong defense and aerospace sectors, signals confidence in Vision 2027 despite Boeing challenges.","language":"en","name":"DUCOMMUN INC","participants":[{"call_id":"6a37b77e87a905623ffa243","human_verified":false,"mentions":1,"name":"Sam","organization":"","participant_id":"09a0d0e4-4741-48b1-bc7f-8d301dd1d5a0","role":"Unknown"},{"call_id":"6a37b77e87a905623ffa243","human_verified":false,"mentions":1,"name":"Simone","organization":"","participant_id":"1fc9df5c-e05d-40ed-9b5b-6c2873e35c5c","role":"Unknown"},{"call_id":"6a37b77e87a905623ffa243","human_verified":false,"mentions":1,"name":"Siman","organization":"","participant_id":"518c723d-8d44-4981-a322-76d05dafcfd0","role":"Unknown"},{"call_id":"6a37b77e87a905623ffa243","human_verified":false,"mentions":1,"name":"Michael","organization":"","participant_id":"a54d2050-4c1a-42b2-b6bc-20bcff11891b","role":"Unknown"},{"call_id":"6a37b77e87a905623ffa243","human_verified":false,"mentions":2,"name":"Michael C.

Thanks everyone for joining us today for our third quarter conference call today and as usual, I'll give an update of the current situation at the company. Afterwards, Simon will review our financials in detail. Let me start off again on this quarterly call with the Ducommun's Vision 2027 game plan for Investors the strategy and vision were developed coming out of the COVID pandemic over the summer and fall of 2022, unanimously approved by the Ducommun Board in November 2022 and then presented to investors the following month in New York where we got excellent feedback. Since that time, the Ducommun Management has been executing the Vision 2027 strategy by increasing the revenue percentage of engineered product and aftermarket content, consolidating its facility or rooftop footprint, consistent continuing its target acquisition program, executing our offloading strategy with defense Primes and high growth segments of the defense budget, value added pricing initiatives, and by expanding content on key commercial aerospace platforms. All of us here, as well as my fellow board members continue to have a high level of conviction in the Vision 2027 strategy and financial goals and believe the many catalysts ahead present a unique value creation opportunity for shareholders. The Q3 2024 results are another great example of our strategy and initiatives working. Q3 was our second consecutive quarter of record revenue. Gross margin represents another very strong performance for Ducommun. Revenues exceeded 200 million for the first time ever, growing 2.6% over the prior year and this quarter is our fifth consecutive quarter above 190 million in revenue. Strong year over year growth in our radar, electronic warfare and missile programs drove our military and space revenues to 6% growth over prior year. Defense business has now been over $100 million in revenue for the fourth time in the last five quarters. Remain optimistic about the growth ahead. I also want to point out that Northrop Grumman was our second largest customer for revenue this quarter, a first at Ducommun, and up from Q3 last year by over 100% to over $17 million. This will moderate going forward but is a great sign as we move to build scale at other Defense primes. Outside of RTX, our largest customer in our commercial aerospace business, we continue to see excellent growth on the A220 program where we make the skins for the entire fuselage along with strong growth in other Airbus platforms. A real bright spot as well was the A320 Family, up 60% year over year. Things are moving. Business jet revenues powered on and was driven higher by the work we do at Gulfstream, Bombardier and others. The strength at Airbus and with business jets was partially offset by weakness from Boeing platforms which were down over prior year by over 40%, driven by lower build rates earlier in the quarter and the impact of the strike in September. Overall, commercial aerospace grew 3% year over year. We now have grown year over year revenue in our commercial aerospace business for 13 consecutive quarters, demonstrating the resilience of our business even in a challenging OEM environment with Spirit and Boeing. The other good news for Ducommun's commercial aerospace business the fuselage skin project for the 737 Maxit Spirit which I've been mentioning is being outsourced from their internal operation. We received first article in September and shipped our first production set last month 2025. Revenue for the four skins should be over $3 million. The four-skin section, which is less than 10% of the fuselage, adds $22,000 to our ship set for the max and we continue to drive that number higher and higher for the program. I also want to add that we are picking up more content on the 787 Dreamliner for all models due to a share shift from a competitor in 2025. We'll have more details for you on the next call. It is significant. Another record highlight in Q3 was gross margins of 26.2% for the quarter, up 350 basis points year over year from 22.7% and 20 basis points compared to the second quarter as we continue to realize benefits from our strategic value pricing initiatives, productivity improvements, favorable product mix, growing engineered product portfolio with aftermarket and initial restructuring savings. In addition, our Monrovia, California facility is now closed and our Berryville architectural facility is down to less than 10 people to maintain capability until the receiving plant in Guaymas, Mexico is certified for the Tomahawk Missile missile program. We're already seeing cost savings from these facility closures and we see these savings be higher as the receiving plants ramp up production in 2025. Stay tuned for adjusted operating income margins in Q3. The team delivered 10.5%, a record performance and well ahead of the 8.9% number in Q3 2023. The this is a great result driven by the continued growth in our engineered product businesses, favorable product mix impact of our strategic pricing initiatives and our restructuring savings during the quarter, adjusted EBITDA was another Great story in Q3 achieving 31.9 million and expanding to 15.8% for the first time. This is 90 basis points above prior year and 60 basis points over the second quarter. This continues the outstanding momentum we've seen each quarter this year as we work towards the 18% goal. In our Vision 2027 plan. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.67 a share in Q3 2024 versus $0.22 a share for Q3 2023 and with the adjustments diluted EPS was an impressive $0.99 a share compared to diluted EPS of $0.70 in the prior year quarter. The higher GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS during the quarter was driven by improved operating income as well as lower interest costs due to our hedging strategy put in place this year in January. The company's consolidated backlog continues to be strong at 1,044,000,000, decreasing 24 million sequentially but increasing over 85 million year over year. Defense backlog increased 97 million compared to the prior year quarter and is at 592 million with new orders for TOW Missiles, MESA Airborne Surveillance as well as other platforms. As discussed, we've experienced the pause in the order segment for the TOW missile case, but now it is coming back strong with better pricing and will be manufactured on low cost Guaymas Mexico facility where previously it was produced in Monrovia, California. The commercial aerospace backlog decreased sequentially by 20 million but was still up 8 million on a year over year basis. As for the 2024 revenue guidance with Boeing and the movement of three major programs out of Monrovia and Berryville, we are guiding to the lower end of single digits with an expected range of 3 to 4% for the full year. The three major programs being moved will all start up again in 2025 and the max build rates, though still weak in Q4 will start to recover as Boeing employees now return to work. We are well positioned for the ba recovery in 2025 and 2026 for both the Max and the 787 Dreamliner. Now let me provide some additional color on our markets, products and programs beginning with our military and space sector. We experienced revenues of 111 million compared to 105 million in Q3 2023 growth was driven by radar electronic warfare programs as well as F15 and the Blackhawk. These are partially offset by weakness in Apache which is in the middle of being transferred out of Monrovia and the Joint Strike Fighter revenues. The third quarter's military and space revenue represented 55% of Newcomens revenues in the period, down from 59% for the full year back in 2022 and 70% in 2021. We expected this trend and reflects commercial aerospace getting stronger for Ducommun providing good balance. We also ended the third quarter with a backlog of 592 million, an increase of 97 million year over year, representing 57% of Ducommen's total backlog. Within our Commercial Aerospace operations, third quarter revenue continued to grow, increasing 3% year over year to 85 million, driven mainly by growth on the A220 and A320 platforms as well as with business jets offset by slowing rates on the 737 Max. As mentioned earlier, we believe a much better story is ahead for Boeing and the MAX now that strike is resolved and the return to their projected production rates in 2025. Also keep an eye on the 787 Dreamliner as we move higher on the rates for Boeing. The backlog within our Commercial Aerospace business was 431 million at the end of the third quarter, increasing 8 million compared to prior year, a solid number given the temporary weakness in the commercial aerospace markets. With that, I'll have Suma review our financial results in detail."},{"end_time":"1360570","segment_id":4,"speaker":"Suman Mukherjee","start_time":"802300","text":"Suman thank you Steve. As a reminder, please see the company's Q3 10-Q and Q3 earnings release for a further description of information mentioned on today's call. As Steve discussed, our third quarter results reflected another period of strong performance with growth in both our commercial aerospace and military end markets as well as continued improvement in our margins. In addition, we also made good progress on our facility consolidation efforts during the quarter, which has benefited us in 2024 and will drive more meaningful synergies in 2025 and beyond. With all this, we feel like 2024 is showing good momentum that will continue to drive our performance towards our Vision 2027 goals. Now turning to our third quarter results, revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was 201.4 million versus 196.3 million for the third quarter of 2023. The year over year increase of 2.6% reflects growth in both commercial aerospace and military and space, highlighted by 6.6 million of growth across military and space platforms and 2.8 million of growth in our commercial aerospace platforms. We posted total gross profit of 52.7 million or 26.2% of revenue for the quarter versus 44.6 million or 22.7% of revenue in the prior period. We continue to provide adjusted gross margins as we have certain non GAAP cost of sales items in the current and prior year period relating to inventory, step up amortization on our recent acquisitions, restructuring charges and the impact from the Guaymas fire on our operations. On an adjusted basis, our gross margins were 26.5% in Q3 2024 versus 24.1% in Q3 2023. The improvement in gross margin was driven by our growing engineered product portfolio as well as favorable product mix in our manufacturing services businesses, strategic pricing initiatives, productivity improvements and restructuring savings. We continue to make progress working through a difficult operating environment with supply chain and labor. Through our proactive efforts, including strategic buys in our inventory investments, we have been able to avoid any significant impacts thus far on our business. During the third quarter of 2024, we reduced our inventory by 16 million from Q2 while still keeping our performance centers positioned to meet our 2024 delivery commitments and ready for a ramp up in commercial aerospace build rates. We continue to look for opportunities to unwind our working capital investments to improve our cash flow. Ducomment reported operating income for Q3 was 15.3 million or 7.6% of revenue, compared to $8.6 million or 4.4% of revenue in the prior year period. Adjusted operating income was $21.1 million or 10.5% of revenue this quarter compared to $17.5 million or 8.9% of revenue in the comparable period last year. The Company reported net income for the third quarter of 2024 of 10.1 million or $0.67 per diluted share, compared to net income of 3.2 million or $0.22 per diluted share a year ago. On an adjusted basis, the Company reported net income of 14.8 million, or $0.99 per diluted share compared to adjusted net income of 10.3 million or $0.70 in Q3 2023. The higher net income and adjusted net income during the quarter was driven by the higher operating income and adjusted operating income. Additionally, our interest rate hedge helped to reduce our year over year interest expense. Now let me turn to our segment results. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenues of $86 million in the third quarter of 2024 versus $85.5 million last year. The year over year increase from reflects 3.7 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, including the A320 and A220, in addition to business jets and other commercial aerospace. The 3.3 million, of lower revenue within the Military and Space markets was driven by a decline in Apache revenue as we shut down production in our Monrovia facility, offset by growth we saw in Black Hawk Structural Systems. Operating income for the quarter was 8.3 million or 9.6% of revenue compared to 6.7 million or 7.9% of revenue for the prior year quarter. Excluding restructuring charges and other adjustments in both years, the segment operating margin was 14.7% in Q3 2024 versus 15.7% in Q3 2023. The slight decline was from higher costs due to the transition of production from Monrovia to Guaymas, partially offset by strategic pricing initiatives and operating leverage from higher revenues at other performance centers within the segment. Our electronic Systems segment posted revenue of 115.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 versus 110.7 million in the prior year period. The increase is attributable to higher revenues from radar and and electronic warfare programs. This was offset by lower revenues from In Flight Entertainment Electronics along with a reduction in our industrial business as we chose to selectively prune non core business Electronic systems. Operating income for the third quarter was 18.9 million or 16.4% of revenue versus 12.7 million or 11.5% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding restructuring charges and other adjustments in both years, the segment operating margin was 16.8% in Q3 2024 versus 13.4% in Q3 2023. The year over year increase was primarily due to shifting mix with higher growth in revenues and profitability in our engineered product businesses along with strategic value pricing initiatives as well as savings from the restructuring program. Restructuring savings were driven by the transition of product lines from our Berryville performance center to other facilities. Next, I would like to provide an update on our ongoing restructuring program. As a reminder and as discussed previously, we commenced a restructuring initiative back in 2022. These actions are being taken to better position the company for stronger performance in the short and long term. This includes the shutdown of our facilities in Monrovia, California and Berryville, Arkansas and the transfer of that work to our low cost operation in Guaymas, Mexico and to other existing performance centers in the United States. We continue to make progress on these transitions and are working diligently with our customers Boeing and Raytheon to obtain the requisite approvals. During Q3 2024, we recorded 1.9 million in restructuring charges. We expect to incur an additional 2 to 3 million in restructuring expenses as we complete the program. Upon the completion of our restructuring program, we expect to generate 11 to 13 million in annual savings from our actions and are already beginning to see some realization of savings from these actions. This year we anticipate selling the land and building at both Monrovia and Berryville, turning next to liquidity and capital resources. Year to date Q3 2024 we generated $15.8 million in cash flow from operating activities which was an improvement compared to year to date Q3 2023 generation of 4.6 million. The improvement was due to higher net income of $24.7 million as well as improvements compared to prior year in inventories and accounts payable. As of the end of the third quarter we had available liquidity of 218.3 million comprising of the unutilized portion of our revolver and cash on hand. Our existing credit facility was put in place in July 2022 at an opportune time in the credit markets, allowing us to reduce our spread, increase the size of our revolver and allowing us the flexibility to execute on our acquisition strategy. Interest expense was 3.8 million compared to 5.4 million in Q3 of 2023. The year over year improvement in interest cost was due to the interest rate hedge going into effect in November 2021. We put in place an interest rate hedge that went into effect for a seven year period starting January 2024 and pegs the one month term so far at 170 basis points for 150 million of our debt. The hedge resulted in interest savings of 1.4 million in Q3 2024 and will continue to drive significant interest cost savings in 2024 and beyond. To conclude the financial review for Q3 2024, I would like to say that the third quarter results continued our momentum this year and positions us well for the rest of 2024. I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks."},{"end_time":"1416400","segment_id":5,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"1361380","text":"Steve okay, thanks Simon. In closing look Q3 Excellent quarter, a record in some cases. Many highlights for the company and our shareholders as we realize the gains we all expect from our Vision 2027 strategy, especially around margin expansion. It's working, we're not surprised, and the progress on gross and EBITDA, margin expansion has especially been a highlight. We're also tracking well against the goals of 18% EBITDA,, margins and 25% or more, of engineered product and aftermarket revenues for 2027. I could not be happier. Finally, with the Boeing strike now behind us, commercial bill rates heading higher along with stronger defense activity including FMS ahead, I feel great about the next few years for all of us. So thank you again for listening and we'll turn it over for questions."},{"end_time":"1438720","segment_id":6,"speaker":"UNKNOWN","start_time":"1417440","text":"Thank you. As a reminder to ask a question, Please press star 11 on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press star 11 again. One moment.

We do a lot of the airborne surveillance electronics. We do power packs. This whole MESA, program which kind of comes every two years, which is a huge order for us as old Northrop, and we're sole source on that. So we'll continue to drive that business. So it's a lot of electronics, a lot of it's in our Huntsville operation in Arkansas. But we're doing other things as well. I'm actually, two weeks from now, I'm going to be with their leadership out in Baltimore because we're looking for even bigger things ahead. So my point about bringing the whole thing up is that we've talked about this over the years about, okay, you know, RTX is a huge customer, for DCO, Steve, that's great. Where else can we be going for, you know, bigger scale defense primes and I think, you know, we're finally starting to crack the code at Northrop, and we love them as far as their partnership and we do a lot of good things, I think value added for them."},{"end_time":"1524490","segment_id":9,"speaker":"Mike Crawford","start_time":"1508320","text":"Okay, great.

I want to wait till the next call. I will tell you that, you know, the increase is going to be double digit. I don't want to go too far right now, but this is a major win for us. This is coming from a competitor. More detail in February, then I'll give you the actual ship set number. I don't want to go, I don't want to get too ahead of ourselves right now, but everything is kind of done-done. But we just need to give a little more time and then we'll be ready."},{"end_time":"1565690","segment_id":11,"speaker":"Mike Crawford","start_time":"1551050","text":"Okay, thank you.

Sounds like, you know, there's been an acceleration here maybe potentially of some outsourcing, both commercial as well as defense. Sounds like you've got plenty of opportunities there. I'm just curious, how much more work can you all take on without the need to, you know, ramp up CapEx? Maybe just let's start with that."},{"end_time":"1637030","segment_id":21,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"1635510","text":"Yes, fair question. Why don't you do that?"},{"end_time":"1703480","segment_id":22,"speaker":"Suman Mukherjee","start_time":"1637190","text":"Yeah, sure. Thanks, Jason, for that question. So we do believe our structures business has a lot of capacity. Max production rates are still pretty low versus the 57 we saw back in 2019. So we're not looking at any significant investments expected there in the near term. On the electronics side, the business is doing well. A lot of that is defense. And so we do expect that as the business continues to grow, we will continue to make expansion on the fringes at a number of our facilities. But those are not very capital intensive expansions. And so we are maintaining kind of our outlook on CapEx spending to be in line with what we had said during our Vision 2027 strategy discussions. And you know, it's going to be kind of in that 20 million range going forward for the next few years."},{"end_time":"1723890","segment_id":23,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"1703800","text":"Jason, let me just jump in here. So also, you know, we're not running heavy second, third shifts, you know, at some of these structural plants. You know, we're, I think we're in very good shape there. So we not only have the capital in place, but we have the time and the plant. Right. So we feel good about where we are and where we're going without capital,"},{"end_time":"1748150","segment_id":24,"speaker":"Jason Gersey","start_time":"1725330","text":"Okay, great. Yeah, that makes good sense. And then just on the M&A front, can you kind of describe the pipeline and the current environment there? I know you've assume some additional acquisitions here over time and I'm just kind of curious how that part of the Vision 2027 framework is shaping up for you."},{"end_time":"1784300","segment_id":25,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"1749750","text":"There is continuous activity on that front. I can tell you. We're super busy looking at things and we have been for the most part this year. We're seeing even more I would say in the past few months, we've got to make the right selection and we've got to make sure that it's the right fit for us. So we're keeping at it. We think there is plenty of opportunity there. And stay tuned in the coming few quarters and we'll continue to have M and A activity."},{"end_time":"1807350","segment_id":26,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"1784380","text":"I think that's fair. I think we are seeing more okay deals. And obviously, Jason, we're, as they say, we're kind of, we're picky eaters. You know, we've had a lot of success with the things we bought in the past. So, you know, we maybe look at things for environmental, other reasons. You know, we just think it's not for us. So we're continuing on, though.

Moley","start_time":"1823000","text":"Hey, morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Good results, I guess, either. Steve, just on the revenue guidance. Now, down at the lower end, I guess it implies a sequential step down into the fourth quarter, maybe 5% or so if you get to that low end. And then I guess I'm just thinking about, you know, what does your margin situation look like? Try and calibrate us maybe for the fourth quarter and then obviously with the Boeing strike, and disruption and then kind of how we recover to that into 25. And it sounds like is the guide all related to the Boeing strike? I know you called out some of the program movement, but I thought that was kind of already in the plan."},{"end_time":"1943670","segment_id":33,"speaker":"Suman Mukherjee","start_time":"1868330","text":"Yeah. So the Boeing piece is definitely a key driver. Right. If you look, look at where we were expecting commercial aerospace build rates to be for the MAX coming into the year versus where they actually panned out and then even versus where things stood at the end of Q2. When we last spoke about our outlook for the year, things have deteriorated dramatically and we have seen shipments to Spirit go to kind of the low 20s. And we are seeing shipments to Boeing come down to zero on the MAX in September. So that is certainly. I mean, the MAX is still less than 10% of our revenues in the current year, but just under. And so it does. While it doesn't have an outsized impact and we've been able to stay broadly in the ballpark of where we had previously guided, there was a little bit of a haircut to accommodate for the MAX changes we've seen in the quarter."},{"end_time":"1982230","segment_id":34,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"1944069","text":"And Michael, let me jump in here for a minute just on these programs. So look, the Tomahawk for instance, is 17 different harnesses. And pretty much as I've mentioned In the past, OEMs are busy with other things and we've really had a fight to get this approved. We have final buy in now. So that's going to come soon. But that's one of the reasons too. In Q4 we just had some delays with OEMs. I mean, it's not anything other than just trying to push this thing over the line. And we're very close on this and we feel great about these transfers. So more coming. And margin should be good. Margins should be good. Got it."},{"end_time":"2001230","segment_id":35,"speaker":"Michael C. Moley","start_time":"1982230","text":"I mean, margins though, in the fourth quarter, I mean it sounds like structural, if you know, I mean max@0 sounds like you're going to be dealing with some decrementals and excess overhead there. And then did we kind of just sort of snap back, maybe to this level in that 14, 15 ish back in the first quarter?"},{"end_time":"2041010","segment_id":36,"speaker":"Suman Mukherjee","start_time":"2001790","text":"Right. Another great question, Mike. And while max shipment rates might be at zero, we will still see some revenue and production activity as required by ASC 606. So we're going to see some because we don't want to shut down the facility and restart again. So there's going to be some continued activity. So it won't technically come down to zero. Even though shipments are at zero, I would say margins are going to stay in the same ballpark. There's going to be maybe some minor impact of volume and product mix, but we're not expecting. And again, we don't guide on margins. But there isn't any reason for us to believe that there's going to be a material change there."},{"end_time":"2055370","segment_id":37,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"2041010","text":"Yeah, Mike, we're in good shape. And that's one of the things about the Vision 2027, coming in with,. We're getting more and more engineered product in the aftermarket. Right. So it might take a little bit on the chin with the max, but we got other things coming in. So that's the beauty of this thing."},{"end_time":"2074560","segment_id":38,"speaker":"Michael C. Moley","start_time":"2056010","text":"Got it, got it. Helpful. And then just the last one. How much is there a lot left of pruning on the industrial sort of piece of the business? I mean, it's kind of subscale now. I'm sure there's just some, some natural product adjacent. But any, anything else, you're either in industrial or anywhere else you're looking to prune."},{"end_time":"2105860","segment_id":39,"speaker":"Steve Oswald","start_time":"2075040","text":"Yeah. You know Let me jump. I just. Because I looked at it the other day. So, look, the only real game that we have in there is there's pretty much card business, which is legacy at Appleton, and a few other things we might do on our plastic extrusion. But our business, business, year over year is down about 50%. So we're really winding down on this, which is what we want. Right. Well, you know, if it's great business for us, you can make some cards and make 40% margin. Okay. You know what I mean? But, you know, customers generally going to move on at some point. So that's. We feel good about it."},{"end_time":"2108660","segment_id":40,"speaker":"Michael C. Moley","start_time":"2106180","text":"Okay, Got it. Perfect.

And, you know, we have full trust in Kelly and the team up there. That's going to be a big lift for us. I mean, our Airbus business was fantastic. And as I've talked about, it's really coming on now because they have internal operations, but, you know, we're way up on the A320, and you know, that's what we want. Right? So it's all coming together for DCO, and obviously our Vision 2027, which is the most important thing, is working, and we're seeing that in our margins and our profit and our engineered product and aftermarket mix.

We filed our Q3 2024 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q with the SEC today. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Oswald for a review of the operating results. Steve okay, thank you Suman. Thanks everyone for joining us today for our third quarter conference call today and as usual, I'll give an update of the current situation at the company. Afterwards, Simon will review our financials in detail. Let me start off again on this quarterly call with the Ducommun's Vision 2027 game plan for Investors the strategy and vision were developed coming out of the COVID pandemic over the summer and fall of 2022, unanimously approved by the Ducommun Board in November 2022 and then presented to investors the following month in New York where we got excellent feedback. Since that time, the Ducommun Management has been executing the Vision 2027 strategy by increasing the revenue percentage of engineered product and aftermarket content, consolidating its facility or rooftop footprint, consistent continuing its target acquisition program, executing our offloading strategy with defense Primes and high growth segments of the defense budget, value added pricing initiatives, and by expanding content on key commercial aerospace platforms. All of us here, as well as my fellow board members continue to have a high level of conviction in the Vision 2027 strategy and financial goals and believe the many catalysts ahead present a unique value creation opportunity for shareholders. The Q3 2024 results are another great example of our strategy and initiatives working. Q3 was our second consecutive quarter of record revenue. Gross margin represents another very strong performance for Ducommun. Revenues exceeded 200 million for the first time ever, growing 2.6% over the prior year and this quarter is our fifth consecutive quarter above 190 million in revenue. Strong year over year growth in our radar, electronic warfare and missile programs drove our military and space revenues to 6% growth over prior year. Defense business has now been over $100 million in revenue for the fourth time in the last five quarters. Remain optimistic about the growth ahead. I also want to point out that Northrop Grumman was our second largest customer for revenue this quarter, a first at Ducommun, and up from Q3 last year by over 100% to over $17 million. This will moderate going forward but is a great sign as we move to build scale at other Defense primes. Outside of RTX, our largest customer in our commercial aerospace business, we continue to see excellent growth on the A220 program where we make the skins for the entire fuselage along with strong growth in other Airbus platforms. A real bright spot as well was the A320 Family, up 60% year over year. Things are moving. Business jet revenues powered on and was driven higher by the work we do at Gulfstream, Bombardier and others. The strength at Airbus and with business jets was partially offset by weakness from Boeing platforms which were down over prior year by over 40%, driven by lower build rates earlier in the quarter and the impact of the strike in September. Overall, commercial aerospace grew 3% year over year. We now have grown year over year revenue in our commercial aerospace business for 13 consecutive quarters, demonstrating the resilience of our business even in a challenging OEM environment with Spirit and Boeing. The other good news for Ducommun's commercial aerospace business the fuselage skin project for the 737 Maxit Spirit which I've been mentioning is being outsourced from their internal operation. We received first article in September and shipped our first production set last month 2025. Revenue for the four skins should be over $3 million. The four-skin section, which is less than 10% of the fuselage, adds $22,000 to our ship set for the max and we continue to drive that number higher and higher for the program. I also want to add that we are picking up more content on the 787 Dreamliner for all models due to a share shift from a competitor in 2025. We'll have more details for you on the next call. It is significant. Another record highlight in Q3 was gross margins of 26.2% for the quarter, up 350 basis points year over year from 22.7% and 20 basis points compared to the second quarter as we continue to realize benefits from our strategic value pricing initiatives, productivity improvements, favorable product mix, growing engineered product portfolio with aftermarket and initial restructuring savings. In addition, our Monrovia, California facility is now closed and our Berryville architectural facility is down to less than 10 people to maintain capability until the receiving plant in Guaymas, Mexico is certified for the Tomahawk Missile missile program. We're already seeing cost savings from these facility closures and we see these savings be higher as the receiving plants ramp up production in 2025. Stay tuned for adjusted operating income margins in Q3. The team delivered 10.5%, a record performance and well ahead of the 8.9% number in Q3 2023. The this is a great result driven by the continued growth in our engineered product businesses, favorable product mix impact of our strategic pricing initiatives and our restructuring savings during the quarter, adjusted EBITDA was another Great story in Q3 achieving 31.9 million and expanding to 15.8% for the first time. This is 90 basis points above prior year and 60 basis points over the second quarter. This continues the outstanding momentum we've seen each quarter this year as we work towards the 18% goal. In our Vision 2027 plan. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.67 a share in Q3 2024 versus $0.22 a share for Q3 2023 and with the adjustments diluted EPS was an impressive $0.99 a share compared to diluted EPS of $0.70 in the prior year quarter. The higher GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS during the quarter was driven by improved operating income as well as lower interest costs due to our hedging strategy put in place this year in January. The company's consolidated backlog continues to be strong at 1,044,000,000, decreasing 24 million sequentially but increasing over 85 million year over year. Defense backlog increased 97 million compared to the prior year quarter and is at 592 million with new orders for TOW Missiles, MESA Airborne Surveillance as well as other platforms. As discussed, we've experienced the pause in the order segment for the TOW missile case, but now it is coming back strong with better pricing and will be manufactured on low cost Guaymas Mexico facility where previously it was produced in Monrovia, California. The commercial aerospace backlog decreased sequentially by 20 million but was still up 8 million on a year over year basis. As for the 2024 revenue guidance with Boeing and the movement of three major programs out of Monrovia and Berryville, we are guiding to the lower end of single digits with an expected range of 3 to 4% for the full year. The three major programs being moved will all start up again in 2025 and the max build rates, though still weak in Q4 will start to recover as Boeing employees now return to work. We are well positioned for the ba recovery in 2025 and 2026 for both the Max and the 787 Dreamliner. Now let me provide some additional color on our markets, products and programs beginning with our military and space sector. We experienced revenues of 111 million compared to 105 million in Q3 2023 growth was driven by radar electronic warfare programs as well as F15 and the Blackhawk. These are partially offset by weakness in Apache which is in the middle of being transferred out of Monrovia and the Joint Strike Fighter revenues. The third quarter's military and space revenue represented 55% of Newcomens revenues in the period, down from 59% for the full year back in 2022 and 70% in 2021. We expected this trend and reflects commercial aerospace getting stronger for Ducommun providing good balance. We also ended the third quarter with a backlog of 592 million, an increase of 97 million year over year, representing 57% of Ducommen's total backlog. Within our Commercial Aerospace operations, third quarter revenue continued to grow, increasing 3% year over year to 85 million, driven mainly by growth on the A220 and A320 platforms as well as with business jets offset by slowing rates on the 737 Max. As mentioned earlier, we believe a much better story is ahead for Boeing and the MAX now that strike is resolved and the return to their projected production rates in 2025. Also keep an eye on the 787 Dreamliner as we move higher on the rates for Boeing. The backlog within our Commercial Aerospace business was 431 million at the end of the third quarter, increasing 8 million compared to prior year, a solid number given the temporary weakness in the commercial aerospace markets. With that, I'll have Suma review our financial results in detail. Suman thank you Steve. As a reminder, please see the company's Q3 10-Q and Q3 earnings release for a further description of information mentioned on today's call. As Steve discussed, our third quarter results reflected another period of strong performance with growth in both our commercial aerospace and military end markets as well as continued improvement in our margins. In addition, we also made good progress on our facility consolidation efforts during the quarter, which has benefited us in 2024 and will drive more meaningful synergies in 2025 and beyond. With all this, we feel like 2024 is showing good momentum that will continue to drive our performance towards our Vision 2027 goals. Now turning to our third quarter results, revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was 201.4 million versus 196.3 million for the third quarter of 2023. The year over year increase of 2.6% reflects growth in both commercial aerospace and military and space, highlighted by 6.6 million of growth across military and space platforms and 2.8 million of growth in our commercial aerospace platforms. We posted total gross profit of 52.7 million or 26.2% of revenue for the quarter versus 44.6 million or 22.7% of revenue in the prior period. We continue to provide adjusted gross margins as we have certain non GAAP cost of sales items in the current and prior year period relating to inventory, step up amortization on our recent acquisitions, restructuring charges and the impact from the Guaymas fire on our operations. On an adjusted basis, our gross margins were 26.5% in Q3 2024 versus 24.1% in Q3 2023. The improvement in gross margin was driven by our growing engineered product portfolio as well as favorable product mix in our manufacturing services businesses, strategic pricing initiatives, productivity improvements and restructuring savings. We continue to make progress working through a difficult operating environment with supply chain and labor. Through our proactive efforts, including strategic buys in our inventory investments, we have been able to avoid any significant impacts thus far on our business. During the third quarter of 2024, we reduced our inventory by 16 million from Q2 while still keeping our performance centers positioned to meet our 2024 delivery commitments and ready for a ramp up in commercial aerospace build rates. We continue to look for opportunities to unwind our working capital investments to improve our cash flow. Ducomment reported operating income for Q3 was 15.3 million or 7.6% of revenue, compared to $8.6 million or 4.4% of revenue in the prior year period. Adjusted operating income was $21.1 million or 10.5% of revenue this quarter compared to $17.5 million or 8.9% of revenue in the comparable period last year. The Company reported net income for the third quarter of 2024 of 10.1 million or $0.67 per diluted share, compared to net income of 3.2 million or $0.22 per diluted share a year ago. On an adjusted basis, the Company reported net income of 14.8 million, or $0.99 per diluted share compared to adjusted net income of 10.3 million or $0.70 in Q3 2023. The higher net income and adjusted net income during the quarter was driven by the higher operating income and adjusted operating income. Additionally, our interest rate hedge helped to reduce our year over year interest expense. Now let me turn to our segment results. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenues of $86 million in the third quarter of 2024 versus $85.5 million last year. The year over year increase from reflects 3.7 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, including the A320 and A220, in addition to business jets and other commercial aerospace. The 3.3 million, of lower revenue within the Military and Space markets was driven by a decline in Apache revenue as we shut down production in our Monrovia facility, offset by growth we saw in Black Hawk Structural Systems. Operating income for the quarter was 8.3 million or 9.6% of revenue compared to 6.7 million or 7.9% of revenue for the prior year quarter. Excluding restructuring charges and other adjustments in both years, the segment operating margin was 14.7% in Q3 2024 versus 15.7% in Q3 2023. The slight decline was from higher costs due to the transition of production from Monrovia to Guaymas, partially offset by strategic pricing initiatives and operating leverage from higher revenues at other performance centers within the segment. Our electronic Systems segment posted revenue of 115.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 versus 110.7 million in the prior year period. The increase is attributable to higher revenues from radar and and electronic warfare programs. This was offset by lower revenues from In Flight Entertainment Electronics along with a reduction in our industrial business as we chose to selectively prune non core business Electronic systems. Operating income for the third quarter was 18.9 million or 16.4% of revenue versus 12.7 million or 11.5% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding restructuring charges and other adjustments in both years, the segment operating margin was 16.8% in Q3 2024 versus 13.4% in Q3 2023. The year over year increase was primarily due to shifting mix with higher growth in revenues and profitability in our engineered product businesses along with strategic value pricing initiatives as well as savings from the restructuring program. Restructuring savings were driven by the transition of product lines from our Berryville performance center to other facilities. Next, I would like to provide an update on our ongoing restructuring program. As a reminder and as discussed previously, we commenced a restructuring initiative back in 2022. These actions are being taken to better position the company for stronger performance in the short and long term. This includes the shutdown of our facilities in Monrovia, California and Berryville, Arkansas and the transfer of that work to our low cost operation in Guaymas, Mexico and to other existing performance centers in the United States. We continue to make progress on these transitions and are working diligently with our customers Boeing and Raytheon to obtain the requisite approvals. During Q3 2024, we recorded 1.9 million in restructuring charges. We expect to incur an additional 2 to 3 million in restructuring expenses as we complete the program. Upon the completion of our restructuring program, we expect to generate 11 to 13 million in annual savings from our actions and are already beginning to see some realization of savings from these actions. This year we anticipate selling the land and building at both Monrovia and Berryville, turning next to liquidity and capital resources. Year to date Q3 2024 we generated $15.8 million in cash flow from operating activities which was an improvement compared to year to date Q3 2023 generation of 4.6 million. The improvement was due to higher net income of $24.7 million as well as improvements compared to prior year in inventories and accounts payable. As of the end of the third quarter we had available liquidity of 218.3 million comprising of the unutilized portion of our revolver and cash on hand. Our existing credit facility was put in place in July 2022 at an opportune time in the credit markets, allowing us to reduce our spread, increase the size of our revolver and allowing us the flexibility to execute on our acquisition strategy. Interest expense was 3.8 million compared to 5.4 million in Q3 of 2023. The year over year improvement in interest cost was due to the interest rate hedge going into effect in November 2021. We put in place an interest rate hedge that went into effect for a seven year period starting January 2024 and pegs the one month term so far at 170 basis points for 150 million of our debt. The hedge resulted in interest savings of 1.4 million in Q3 2024 and will continue to drive significant interest cost savings in 2024 and beyond. To conclude the financial review for Q3 2024, I would like to say that the third quarter results continued our momentum this year and positions us well for the rest of 2024. I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve okay, thanks Simon. In closing look Q3 Excellent quarter, a record in some cases. Many highlights for the company and our shareholders as we realize the gains we all expect from our Vision 2027 strategy, especially around margin expansion. It's working, we're not surprised, and the progress on gross and EBITDA, margin expansion has especially been a highlight. We're also tracking well against the goals of 18% EBITDA,, margins and 25% or more, of engineered product and aftermarket revenues for 2027. I could not be happier. Finally, with the Boeing strike now behind us, commercial bill rates heading higher along with stronger defense activity including FMS ahead, I feel great about the next few years for all of us. So thank you again for listening and we'll turn it over for questions. Thank you. As a reminder to ask a question, Please press star 11 on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press star 11 again. One moment. For our first question. Our first question is going to come from the line of Mike Crawford with B. Riley Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Thank you. What is it that you're doing new for Northrop Grumman and where else could you help them? Yeah, well, look, we're again, highlight for me, highlight for the company. We do a lot of the airborne surveillance electronics. We do power packs. This whole MESA, program which kind of comes every two years, which is a huge order for us as old Northrop, and we're sole source on that. So we'll continue to drive that business. So it's a lot of electronics, a lot of it's in our Huntsville operation in Arkansas. But we're doing other things as well. I'm actually, two weeks from now, I'm going to be with their leadership out in Baltimore because we're looking for even bigger things ahead. So my point about bringing the whole thing up is that we've talked about this over the years about, okay, you know, RTX is a huge customer, for DCO, Steve, that's great. Where else can we be going for, you know, bigger scale defense primes and I think, you know, we're finally starting to crack the code at Northrop, and we love them as far as their partnership and we do a lot of good things, I think value added for them. Okay, great. And then on the 787, you've been, I believe, delivering about $90,000 worth of content per aircraft. And where is that heading to now with the share shift that you've won? Yeah, I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have my, this. I want to wait till the next call. I will tell you that, you know, the increase is going to be double digit. I don't want to go too far right now, but this is a major win for us. This is coming from a competitor. More detail in February, then I'll give you the actual ship set number. I don't want to go, I don't want to get too ahead of ourselves right now, but everything is kind of done-done. But we just need to give a little more time and then we'll be ready. Okay, thank you. One last from me, just from these acquired engineered products and aftermarket product businesses, are there any new favorite or, I Guess conversely, unruly children among that set of companies that you're now growing. No, I wouldn't specifically highlight one over the other. We've had good performance across our engineered product Portfolio. That's fair. Okay. Thank you, Simone. Thank you, Steve. Thanks, Mike. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question is going to come from the line of Jason Gersey with Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Great. Good morning, everybody. Hi, Jason. Just a quick question on capacity at the company. Sounds like, you know, there's been an acceleration here maybe potentially of some outsourcing, both commercial as well as defense. Sounds like you've got plenty of opportunities there. I'm just curious, how much more work can you all take on without the need to, you know, ramp up CapEx? Maybe just let's start with that. Yes, fair question. Why don't you do that? Yeah, sure. Thanks, Jason, for that question. So we do believe our structures business has a lot of capacity. Max production rates are still pretty low versus the 57 we saw back in 2019. So we're not looking at any significant investments expected there in the near term. On the electronics side, the business is doing well. A lot of that is defense. And so we do expect that as the business continues to grow, we will continue to make expansion on the fringes at a number of our facilities. But those are not very capital intensive expansions. And so we are maintaining kind of our outlook on CapEx spending to be in line with what we had said during our Vision 2027 strategy discussions. And you know, it's going to be kind of in that 20 million range going forward for the next few years. Jason, let me just jump in here. So also, you know, we're not running heavy second, third shifts, you know, at some of these structural plants. You know, we're, I think we're in very good shape there. So we not only have the capital in place, but we have the time and the plant. Right. So we feel good about where we are and where we're going without capital, Okay, great. Yeah, that makes good sense. And then just on the M&A front, can you kind of describe the pipeline and the current environment there? I know you've assume some additional acquisitions here over time and I'm just kind of curious how that part of the Vision 2027 framework is shaping up for you. There is continuous activity on that front. I can tell you. We're super busy looking at things and we have been for the most part this year. We're seeing even more I would say in the past few months, we've got to make the right selection and we've got to make sure that it's the right fit for us. So we're keeping at it. We think there is plenty of opportunity there. And stay tuned in the coming few quarters and we'll continue to have M and A activity. I think that's fair. I think we are seeing more okay deals. And obviously, Jason, we're, as they say, we're kind of, we're picky eaters. You know, we've had a lot of success with the things we bought in the past. So, you know, we maybe look at things for environmental, other reasons. You know, we just think it's not for us. So we're continuing on, though. There are good news ahead for that. Okay, great. I'll leave it there. Thanks, guys. Thank you, Jason. Good to be with you. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question is going to come from the line of Michael C. Moley with Truist Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Hey, morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Good results, I guess, either. Steve, just on the revenue guidance. Now, down at the lower end, I guess it implies a sequential step down into the fourth quarter, maybe 5% or so if you get to that low end. And then I guess I'm just thinking about, you know, what does your margin situation look like? Try and calibrate us maybe for the fourth quarter and then obviously with the Boeing strike, and disruption and then kind of how we recover to that into 25. And it sounds like is the guide all related to the Boeing strike? I know you called out some of the program movement, but I thought that was kind of already in the plan. Yeah. So the Boeing piece is definitely a key driver. Right. If you look, look at where we were expecting commercial aerospace build rates to be for the MAX coming into the year versus where they actually panned out and then even versus where things stood at the end of Q2. When we last spoke about our outlook for the year, things have deteriorated dramatically and we have seen shipments to Spirit go to kind of the low 20s. And we are seeing shipments to Boeing come down to zero on the MAX in September. So that is certainly. I mean, the MAX is still less than 10% of our revenues in the current year, but just under. And so it does. While it doesn't have an outsized impact and we've been able to stay broadly in the ballpark of where we had previously guided, there was a little bit of a haircut to accommodate for the MAX changes we've seen in the quarter. And Michael, let me jump in here for a minute just on these programs. So look, the Tomahawk for instance, is 17 different harnesses. And pretty much as I've mentioned In the past, OEMs are busy with other things and we've really had a fight to get this approved. We have final buy in now. So that's going to come soon. But that's one of the reasons too. In Q4 we just had some delays with OEMs. I mean, it's not anything other than just trying to push this thing over the line. And we're very close on this and we feel great about these transfers. So more coming. And margin should be good. Margins should be good. Got it. I mean, margins though, in the fourth quarter, I mean it sounds like structural, if you know, I mean max@0 sounds like you're going to be dealing with some decrementals and excess overhead there. And then did we kind of just sort of snap back, maybe to this level in that 14, 15 ish back in the first quarter? Right. Another great question, Mike. And while max shipment rates might be at zero, we will still see some revenue and production activity as required by ASC 606. So we're going to see some because we don't want to shut down the facility and restart again. So there's going to be some continued activity. So it won't technically come down to zero. Even though shipments are at zero, I would say margins are going to stay in the same ballpark. There's going to be maybe some minor impact of volume and product mix, but we're not expecting. And again, we don't guide on margins. But there isn't any reason for us to believe that there's going to be a material change there. Yeah, Mike, we're in good shape. And that's one of the things about the Vision 2027, coming in with,. We're getting more and more engineered product in the aftermarket. Right. So it might take a little bit on the chin with the max, but we got other things coming in. So that's the beauty of this thing. Got it, got it. Helpful. And then just the last one. How much is there a lot left of pruning on the industrial sort of piece of the business? I mean, it's kind of subscale now. I'm sure there's just some, some natural product adjacent. But any, anything else, you're either in industrial or anywhere else you're looking to prune. Yeah. You know Let me jump. I just. Because I looked at it the other day. So, look, the only real game that we have in there is there's pretty much card business, which is legacy at Appleton, and a few other things we might do on our plastic extrusion. But our business, business, year over year is down about 50%. So we're really winding down on this, which is what we want. Right. Well, you know, if it's great business for us, you can make some cards and make 40% margin. Okay. You know what I mean? But, you know, customers generally going to move on at some point. So that's. We feel good about it. Okay, Got it. Perfect. Thanks, guys. Thank you, Mike, as always. Thank you. And as a reminder to ask a question at this time, please press star one one on your telephone. There appears to be no further questions, and I would like to turn the conference back over to Chairman, President and CEO Steve Oswald for closing remarks. Okay, thank you very much and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Look, you know, we feel great about the print. You know, obviously we're thrilled that the strike is now over for Boeing in Seattle, and we look forward to, you know, many, many great years now. And, you know, we have full trust in Kelly and the team up there. That's going to be a big lift for us. I mean, our Airbus business was fantastic. And as I've talked about, it's really coming on now because they have internal operations, but, you know, we're way up on the A320, and you know, that's what we want. Right? So it's all coming together for DCO, and obviously our Vision 2027, which is the most important thing, is working, and we're seeing that in our margins and our profit and our engineered product and aftermarket mix. So all good news from here. Just want to wish you a great day and a safe day. Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.","transcript_id":"08dbdc24-eb19-406e-8585-48803272167d","type":"NON_LIVE"}],"updated_at":"2024-11-07T19:34:33Z"},{"audio":{"content_type":"audio/mpeg","quality":"192kbps","url":"https://cdn.kscope.io/ks-trsc-687a4a24477213000186c295.mp3?key=0168e3f5-cb74-4278-8437-b3db550908bb"},"call_id":"687a4a24477213000186c295","call_title":"Insperity cuts 2025 EPS guidance on higher benefits costs, eyes growth in 2026","created_at":"2025-08-01T12:29:00.633867Z","description":"Q3 2025 Insperity (NSP) Earnings Conference Call","duration":58,"end_time":"2025-08-01T13:27:00Z","exchange":"NYSE","figis":["BBG001S894P4"],"headline":"Insperity reports Q2 EPS of $0.26, lowers 2025 guidance amid rising benefits costs but remains optimistic for 2026 growth through strategic initiatives.","language":"en","name":"Insperity","participants":[{"call_id":"687a4a24477213000186c295","human_verified":false,"mentions":1,"name":"Tom","organization":"Insperity","participant_id":"0d93893d-194c-4df2-9c6b-164f1a4914af","role":"Operator"},{"call_id":"687a4a24477213000186c295","human_verified":false,"mentions":4,"name":"Paul Cervati","organization":"Insperity","participant_id":"34a03ab7-2965-40ab-afb7-3c4b42b75255","role":"Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer"},{"call_id":"687a4a24477213000186c295","human_verified":false,"mentions":5,"name":"Jim Allison","organization":"Insperity","participant_id":"68f313d4-eb1b-4c6f-b42c-8080a777cfaf","role":"Executive Vice President of Finance, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer"},{"call_id":"687a4a24477213000186c295","human_verified":false,"mentions":2,"name":"Andrew Nicholas","organization":"William Blair","participant_id":"b78c9b30-fff2-4439-9699-002b3bd9206e","role":"Equity Analyst at William Blair"},{"call_id":"687a4a24477213000186c295","human_verified":false,"mentions":2,"name":"Toby Sommer","organization":"Truist","participant_id":"35686001-b3a3-40de-9c2c-541fe822533c","role":"Equity Analyst at Truist"},{"call_id":"687a4a24477213000186c295","human_verified":false,"mentions":2,"name":"Jeff Martin","organization":"Roth Capital Partners","participant_id":"fa2a3b8c-1a14-47ed-ab82-c00de3893fa2","role":"Equity Analyst at Roth Capital Partners"},{"call_id":"687a4a24477213000186c295","human_verified":false,"mentions":1,"name":"Mark Marcon","organization":"Baird","participant_id":"4a2f0164-a3e8-4916-92a5-0ec0766715f1","role":"Equity Analyst at Baird"},{"call_id":"687a4a24477213000186c295","human_verified":false,"mentions":2,"name":"Andrew Polkowitz","organization":"JP Morgan","participant_id":"435d9dc8-e052-41c6-9240-7a0d023bbfe8","role":"Equity Analyst at JP Morgan"}],"securities":[{"figi":"BBG000BJ41X2","figi_composite":"BBG000BJ41X2","figi_share_class":"BBG001S894P4","isin":"US45778Q1076","mic_code":"XNYS","name":"INSPERITY INC","refinitiv_exch_code":"NYQ","symbol":"NSP"}],"start_time":"2025-08-01T12:29:00Z","status":"COMPLETED","summary":{"call_id":"687a4a24477213000186c295","created_at":"2025-08-01T12:29:00Z","language":"","summary":"Insperity reported second quarter 2025 EPS of $0.26, falling slightly below expectations due to higher benefits costs, with adjusted EBITDA at $32 million.\nGrowth in paid worksite employees was 0.7% year-over-year with improved sales efficiency despite a smaller sales team.\nThe company is focusing on a strategic partnership with Workday, aiming for accelerated growth and improved profitability in 2026.\nInsperity is implementing pricing increases, plan design changes, and negotiating contract renewals to mitigate high benefits costs.\nFuture outlook includes worksite employee growth of 1-2% for 2025, with adjusted EPS forecasted at $1.81 to $2.51.\nOperational highlights include a strong client retention rate, investment in the Workday partnership, and cash dividends totaling $45 million year-to-date.\nManagement emphasized the potential of the Insperity HR Scale product in collaboration with Workday, anticipating a beta launch in early 2026.","summary_id":"5fdd5ef7-6568-4fcd-af11-aea5e108758e","symbol":"","transcript_id":"","updated_at":"2025-08-01T12:29:00Z"},"symbol":"NSP","ticker":"NSP","transcripts":[{"language":"en-US","segments":[{"end_time":"49230","segment_id":0,"speaker":"OPERATOR","start_time":"880","text":"Good morning, My name is Tom and I will be your conference operator today.

Let me begin by outlining our plan for this morning's call. First, I'm going to discuss the details behind our second quarter 2025 financial results. Paul will then comment on our second quarter results, the ongoing implementation of our Workday strategic partnership, and our outlook for accelerated growth and improved profitability in 2026. I will return to provide our financial guidance for the third quarter and full year 2025. We will then end the call with a question and answer session. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that Paul or I may make forward looking statements during today's call which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. In addition, some of our discussion may include non GAAP financial measures. For a more detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, such forward looking statements and reconciliations of non GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures, please see the company's public filings, including the Form 8K filed today, which are available on our website. This morning we reported second quarter EPS of $0.26 and adjusted EBITDA of $32 million. These results fell slightly under the low end of our forecasted range by $0.03 per share and $1,000,000 respectively, primarily due to a continuation of higher than expected benefits costs. I will provide additional details in just a minute. Our unit growth was within our forecasted range with an average number of paid worksite employees increasing 0.7% over Q2 of 2024 to 309,115. Our sales force demonstrated resiliency and solid productivity in a market that continued to face many economic uncertainties. Worksite employees paid from new sales increased by 2% over Q2 of 2024, reflecting an increase in sales efficiency from a team that is smaller and more tenured than it was a year ago. Our client renewals and service teams collaborated well to produce strong client retention averaging 99% per month and in line with our prior year results. Net hiring within the client base showed some improvement throughout the quarter, slightly exceeding both our expectations and Q2 2024 levels but remaining well below historical norms. Gross profit per Worksite employee in Q2 2025 was $240 per month, down from $282 in Q2 of 2024. You may recall that Q2 2024 results were positively impacted by favorable development of healthcare claims which had totaled $25 million. In contrast, benefits costs in Q2 2025 continued to trend negatively exceeding our forecast by $12 million of this amount 8 million related to higher than expected pharmacy costs driven by higher utilization of specialty drugs such as the GLP1s and a related acceleration in the unit cost of pharmacy on a per script basis due to a change in the mix of prescriptions towards higher cost drugs. The remaining $4 million was primarily attributable to a modest increase in incurred but not reported claims that we expect to pay in the future. Based on recent claims payment patterns, we have not seen further develop deterioration in claim development related to older periods like we did in Q1 and we have seen some indications that that the previously discussed acceleration in inpatient and outpatient service utilization has moderated somewhat but remains elevated. We did see large claim frequency continue at an elevated level with cancer and heart related conditions showing the largest year over year increases. However, we have not seen signs of adverse selection among new clients as that large claim activity remains in a normal historical range as reported benefits cost per covered employee increased 9.6% year over year in Q2 and by 9% on a year to date basis. These results are skewed somewhat higher by the timing of recording favorable claims experience in the 2024 period and unfavorable claims experience in the 2025 period, but the fact remains that benefits costs continue to trend at a higher year over year rate, even slightly higher than the top end of our prior forecasted range. While this higher benefits cost trend has significantly impacted our earnings in 2025, we are executing plans designed to drive significant profitability improvement in 2026 through a careful combination of of pricing increases, plan design changes and the negotiation of the anticipated renewal of our contract with UHC. As to pricing, we have and continue to implement higher pricing targets for both new and renewing business in a strategic and methodical way. As we discussed in our Q1 call, we have been putting those bids out for a few months now and our renewal discussions with clients do not appear to have changed in any meaningful way. We expect that the impact of these pricing measures will start to accumulate during the second half of this year and continue into 2026 as expected. We continue to see clients and plan participants migrate to lower cost plan options, which is a normal response to help offset the impact of higher prices. Plan migration has historically helped to mitigate the impact of higher cost trends over time. In addition, we have determined and are in the process of implementing benefit plan design changes effective January 2026 that are designed to further mitigate future cost trend and maintain our planned competitiveness in the marketplace. Our contract extension discussions with UHC are ongoing and addressing the elevated pharmacy cost trends and the expanding use of specialty drugs is a high priority as we execute this plan. A key takeaway is that the challenges we are facing are not unique to insperity and we believe that the approach we are taking to address them are commonplace. To address current market conditions, operating expense management continues to be a keen area of focus and we have seen a company wide alignment and execution that continued to successfully manage operating expenses below budget across all expense categories while continuing to invest in our strategic priorities. On a year over year basis, operating expenses decreased by 3% with the most significant reductions in in travel, professional fees and other GNA costs. During the second quarter we invested $14 million in our Workday strategic partnership which was consistent with Q2 of 2020 2024. Our effective tax rate was impacted by the amount of non deductible expenses as a proportion of pre. During the second quarter we continued to return capital to our shareholders through a regular dividend program, paying $22 million in cash dividends. On a year to date basis, we have paid cash dividends of $45 million and repurchased 224,000 shares of stock at a cost of $19 million. We ended the quarter with $114 million of adjusted cash and we had $280 million available under our credit facility. Now at this time I'd like to turn the call over to Paul."},{"end_time":"1314940","segment_id":3,"speaker":"Paul Sarvati","start_time":"570860","text":"Thank you Jim and thank you all for joining our call. Despite our reported Q2 results and the lower guidance for this year, we remain confident in our outlook for accelerated growth and improved profitability in 2026. This is due to several reasons I'll cover today, starting with the growth momentum recently achieved and the drivers we expect to continue growth acceleration over the balance of the year and into 2026. I'll also cover our updated HR Solution portfolio announced yesterday and our excellent progress on Insperity HR Scale. Our new joint offering being developed through our strategic partnership with Workday. I'll finish with the robust plan we are executing over the balance of the year and continuing into next year leading to our positive outlook. The highlight of the first half of 2025 is the resilience, agility and focus on sales and retention amid a complex and shifting market landscape. We successfully addressed the evolving uncertainty experienced by small and medium sized businesses resulting from macroeconomic tariff and policy developments in the first half of the year and challenges from stemming from specific insurance carrier publicity issues in Q2. Even though year over year growth in paid worksite employees was 0.7% in each of the first two quarters, an underlying increase of more than 3% occurred from the low point in February through the end of July. All three growth drivers including sales, client retention and net hiring with the existing client base contributed to this growth acceleration and were stronger than last year. Booked sales also showed relative strength in the face of some significant headwinds, which we accomplished with 11% fewer trained business performance advisors selling a slightly greater number of worksite employees than in the same period last year. This sales efficiency improvement of 13% in Q2 validated the sales organization changes, put in place early in the year and is encouraging as we approach the fall selling season. A key driver of these booked sales results in the quarter was our successful marketing programs that achieved our qualified lead goal and converted a solid number of leads into discovery calls and opportunities to bid for our business performance advisors. Our marketing team also completed our new product architecture and updated our HR Solutions portfolio to rebrand our flagship PEO service as Insperity HR360, our traditional employment solution as Insperity HR Core and working with our strategic partner Workday to name our joint solution appropriately Insperity HR Scale. Each solution is tailored to address specific aspects of human resource management, offering unrivaled, comprehensive support for businesses at every stage of growth and development. Together, these three premium HR solutions expand the total addressable market of SMBs and employees that can be served by Insperity. Our portfolio of add on products is dedicated to solving complex challenges for these companies and improving the lives of business owners and their employees over time. We believe that offering solutions to these clients such as our recent addition of Insperity Contractor Management powered by Wingspan and to eligible employees such as our Insperity Perks plus program may add significant revenue streams to the company or increase the stickiness of our solutions. Now I would like to focus on Insperity HR Scale and the excellent progress we have made on the way to bringing this unique solution to the marketplace. The four defined pillars of our work in the Strategic Partnership have included our Insperity Corporate Tenant, our exclusive PEO Client Tenant, our Deployment and Enablement services and our joint Go to Market Plan. Our Corporate Tenant was successfully launched earlier this year and important milestones were achieved in all 3 of our remaining major initiatives in the second quarter. Our exclusive PEO Client Tenant is the major project deliverable Embedding Workday Human Capital Management as the client facing technology into the Insperity 360 comprehensive HR service and Technology Platform to Create Insperity HR Scale we are pleased to announce today that a detailed work and testing plan developed and agreed upon by both Workday and Insperity teams have established a target Go Live date for Insperity HR Scale Beta clients early next year. This is an important step and our enablement and deployment team is ready to work with the selected Beta clients for the ramp up to the anticipated Go Live date. Although this plan is detailed, precise and very well thought out, there are remaining risks that could cause the date to move out a bit further. But in any event we have a direct line of sight to launch Insperity HR Scale. We have agreed on a plan for the Beta clients. We are actively working to define a timeline for a number of new clients and an additional group of current Insperity clients to become Insperity HR Scale clients later in 2026. I mentioned last quarter the completion of the Go to Market plan for HR Scale with Workday. Senior leadership and other key personnel from both companies agreed upon a plan and methodology to take our joint solution to the market. Together we are aligned on the target market, the product name messaging and competitive positioning, the Sales motion and most importantly, we formed a new POD or Product Oriented Delivery team focused on achieving the objectives set by the leadership of both companies. We achieved our goal of establishing this team in Q2 and began co selling discovery calls with target prospects in July. This team is focused on identifying suitable early adopter candidates, refining the appropriate sales motion and selling the first new Insperity HR Scale clients. Obviously this effort has just begun. However, in our view it's off to a very exciting start. The receptivity by prospects of the investment and commitment of Insperity and workday to a strategic partnership focused on this underserved target market has been strong and encouraging. Our market research has shown conceptual buy in by mid market companies to Insperity HR Scale which is designed to focus on affordability, ease and speed of deployment, reducing complexity and agility as companies scale One of the most exciting milestones achieved recently is the completion of the Insperity HR Scale pricing strategy provided by a leading consultancy firm. Based upon extensive market research, these results affirmed the target market's intense need for both HR services and technology and validating the premium product fit of Insperity HR Scale. This research specifically identified how components of Insperity HR Scale are valued by the target market and determined their willingness to pay at various levels. The research supports HR Scale premium pricing potential compared to historical HR360 pricing for mid market accounts. This has provided what we need to establish our initial pricing framework including upfront deployment and enablement fees, ongoing monthly HR service and technology support fees at the level exceeding our expectation, yet within the value range that we believe the target market is willing and expecting to pay. This also provided valuable information to determine a pricing roadmap to align with the Insperity HR Scale product roadmap into the future. Now let me provide some context for our growth and Profitability Outlook for 2026 based upon executing our plans for the balance of the year. This plan has three key elements including continuing growth acceleration, recovering our gross profit margin and leveraging our operating expense management trend every year. The success of our fall sales and retention campaign is pivotal to achieving the desired starting point for the coming year in paid worksite employees, setting the stage for continued growth acceleration. This year we are starting earlier, offering strong incentives and investing more to increase the likelihood and degree of success in sales and retention. We are officially launching the campaign in just a few weeks, which is approximately one month earlier than previous years. We have strong incentives for employees and prospective clients for sales and retention activity and results. We've also allocated a portion of the year to date operating expense savings to invest in in marketing opportunities. We expect to drive an increase in sales leads and opportunities. We expect to be making announcements and increasing advertising soon that will reveal significant potential return on this added investment. Another input to growth expectations is the state of the small to medium sized business community, which we believe is at an important inflection point compared to the last few years of one macroeconomic speed bump after another from inflation and interest rates and to government policy and tariffs. The recent federal legislation signed into law is validating of support for the small business community, especially on the tax and investment outlook. We believe this may play out to be a catalyst for expansion in the SMB community which could move the hiring trend back to historical levels next year. The second key element in Our game plan for the balance of the year is execution of our Gross Profit margin Recovery plan in the Healthcare Pricing and Cost framework. Jim has described three critical incentive initiatives including pricing allocations, plan design changes and our contract negotiation with our insurance carrier. All three have moved forward rapidly in the last quarter and despite the benefits cost trend being slightly worse than expected, our recovery plan is progressing along and we believe we are in a position to see improvement as we execute the recovery plan this year and heading into 2026. Another aspect of our positive outlook for next year is continuing the recent operating expense management focus to ensure operating leverage can be a part of our three year plan beginning in 2026. One key element of this plan is to continue down our AI path, which we believe can be significant in our business model. Development of our AI capabilities, as I've discussed in the past, is well underway and in use by our client facing HR professionals. Our AI focus is to improve the efficiency, value, productivity and quality of our services to the benefit of our customers and our internal operations. Our strategy is to leverage the combination of our own proprietary tool to optimize Insperity's HR and service delivery expertise with other specific AI capabilities native to platforms that we use across the company. So, in summary, we have responded well to the challenges we have faced this year to date and our plan for the balance of the year is on course toward accelerating growth and improved profitability in 2026 and beyond. At this point, I'd like to pass the call back to Jim. Thanks Paul."},{"end_time":"1556240","segment_id":4,"speaker":"Jim Allison","start_time":"1315660","text":"Now let me provide an update to our full year 2025 outlook. As Paul discussed, we have started to see some modest worksite employee growth acceleration in recent months. In addition, there are indications that clarity around tax policy has buoyed small business economic sentiment. At the same time, we remain cautious about the level of net hiring in the existing client base for the full year. We are now forecasting worksite employee growth of 1% to 2% over 2024. Given the higher benefits cost trends experienced in the first half of the year and more broadly seen in the marketplace at large, we are raising our forecasted range of benefits cost per covered employee by 75 to 100 basis points for the full year, we anticipate that the benefits cost trend will taper down from the 9% we have experienced in the first half of the year for two primary reasons. First year over year comparisons in the first half of 2025 were impacted by last year's favorable claims development and that impact should subside in the second half of the year. In addition, we continue to see favorable changes in our plan demographics and planned migration that historically have helped to favorably impact benefits Cost Trends we continue to expect that operating expenses will decline slightly sequentially in each of the remaining quarters. For the full year, we expect that operating expenses will be an overall reduction compared to 2024. This includes planned spending on the implementation of the Workday Strategic Partnership which we expect to total approximately $58 million in 2025 versus 57 million in 2024 and additional marketing spend for our fall sales campaign. For purposes of adjusted EPS, we are forecasting an effective tax rate of 29% for the full year 2025. The effective tax rate on GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhat higher and could fluctuate based on the level of non deductible expenses as a proportion of pre tax income. Based on all of these factors, we are forecasting full year adjusted EBITDA in a range of 170 million to 205 million dollars. We are forecasting full year adjusted EPS in a range of $1.81 to $2.51. As for Q3, we are forecasting the average paid worksite employees to be in a range of 312,200 to 315,300, which represents an increase of 1 to 2% over Q3 of 2024. We are forecasting adjusted EBITDA in a range of 24 to $44 million and adjusted EPS in a range of $0.06 to $0.49. As economic concerns show signs of stabilizing, business owners continue to see employee retention, engagement benefits and cost of compliance as significant concerns. We believe that these are positive trends as we approach our fall sales and client renewal season. We are executing a pricing plan and implementing plan design changes in 2026 that we believe will address the elevated benefits cost trend environment. We remain focused on operating expense management and have initiated a three year planning process to further sharpen the alignment of our sales, operating operating and development plans with our updated HR Solutions portfolio strategy as we look to drive improved profitability in 2026 and beyond. At this time, I'd like to open up the call for questions."},{"end_time":"1593150","segment_id":5,"speaker":"OPERATOR","start_time":"1558080","text":"Thank you. The floor is now open for questions.

But we also have just now received all of the information that we need for the pricing elements and that is also super important. And it was, as I mentioned in my remarks, it exceeded our expectations on how different elements are valued. Frankly, the value of the service component was even higher than expected. And the ability for the client to look at the different pieces of what we're offering and our ability to price those accordingly, including upfront fees, ongoing service fees, ongoing technology support fees, fees for adding technology elements over time. There's a lot of pieces to it. And now we are in the process and will happen over this next quarter we will lock down what would be called our, I guess I'd call it like our recommended pricing for clients at different sizes, different levels, et cetera. And then we'll be able to more closely determine what we will actually apply in pricing to these groups of clients that are being such an important part of our launch path. And obviously we will give advantages to those clients to come on. But the reality is this is validating our long term plan for really solving our success penalty of having companies grow out of our business model and having a great new avenue for New clients that are much larger coming into the company. So we'll be working on how this will be modeled in the future because I know that's an issue for you all as well.

So the good news is that we, you know, have seen underlying hiring at a higher level than what has been happening now. Some of what happens this time of year is a natural summer help element and other things. But we can, in our analysis, we see that underlying there, there is movement, the right direction. It's still well below historical levels. But I also believe the confidence level we're already hearing and seeing, even post the legislation, I really feel like we're about to see a release there. Now, we haven't budgeted a lot of that in to our model going forward the balance of the year, but we do believe that things are already better out of this first half of the year. There was only one month that was somewhat of a negative. So that's good. That's moving the right direction and, and we're going to do all we can to help our customers continue to grow."},{"end_time":"1935970","segment_id":15,"speaker":"OPERATOR","start_time":"1928850","text":"Thank you.

Yeah. So, you know, if you think about the typical scenario for a company who's having these types of needs, let me just remind you what we have validated is there's a deep need in this target marketplace for both services, HR services, having a better HR function, a strategic HR function that's really working, and the technology to help make that happen efficiently and effectively. And so if you are such a client out there today, in order to move that direction, the amount of time that it takes, the amount of investment it takes, the amount of complexity, it's all very difficult, takes a long time. And most companies have a mixed bag or a hodgepodge of components that they're trying to make all this happen. And we're bringing them a rifle to nail this down and have ultimate scalability on both the service and the technology side. Insperity. HR scale is the perfect name for this. Now, if I'm one of those prospects and I look at. Wait a minute, you're telling me that insperity and workday are totally committed, investing significantly to having this solved for me long term, hey, I want on. I want on that ship. And if it takes me, you know, even 18 months from now, that's how long it would take me. Try to do it myself and piecemeal this thing together. And it would cost more and it would be a lot harder. And I don't really have the people to make that happen myself. Anyway, I'm telling you, this is what we're seeing in the marketplace. And I'm fully. You can hear me. I'm excited about the fact that we get to. We've been talking to prospects already. They connect immediately, conceptually to having these two great companies help them solve this for the long term and, you know, to be a Part of it to get in this queue, I think is going to be a, you know, a desirable thing for these prospects now, now that we're going to be able to lock down how we can price and offer the right kind of incentives to be a part earlier, maybe part, be the early adopters. That's great. You know, that's a, that's an excellent step in addition to that. But I just believe we see the demand out there and the need, I wouldn't even call it demand because they don't know the solution's out there yet. But the need for what we're bringing to the table is clear and the value of it, perceived value of it, we believe is going to be high. So, you know, that's why being out there now, having our team already out there having these conversations and, and being able to get this on people's plate to put in their plan for the future is very appropriate.

Once we get this in place, you know, we're already having good success in the mid market space and this is going to enhance that and allow for us to grow the, you know, the business, the worksite employee growth, the unit growth more rapidly with fewer BPAs. So that's the game plan. There will be some growth, you know, pretty nominal for the balance of the year and into next year. But the efficiency gain that is evident is another reason why we are really ready to market more heavily and get more opportunities into the hands of these BPAs whose effectiveness is at a high level."},{"end_time":"2619180","segment_id":45,"speaker":"OPERATOR","start_time":"2611820","text":"Thank you.

Please go ahead."},{"end_time":"2678250","segment_id":46,"speaker":"Mark Marcon","start_time":"2620700","text":"Good morning. I have a couple of questions. Paul and Jim, thanks a lot for all the detail. With regards to the healthcare cost, obviously everybody is seeing the same thing and facing the same pressures. I'm wondering if you have any preliminary Thoughts with regards to when you look at a combination of Plan design change versus pricing versus getting some more favorable treatment from UnitedHealthcare, how do you think of that combination and how much and specifically how much would come from plan design change and how much would come from pricing? I know it's early days and perhaps if there's any sort of regional differences, how should we think about those? And then I have a follow up with regards to workday."},{"end_time":"2683060","segment_id":47,"speaker":"Jim Allison","start_time":"2682420","text":"Yeah, thanks, Mark."},{"end_time":"2743360","segment_id":48,"speaker":"Jim Allison","start_time":"2683620","text":"Appreciate the question. What I would say is, you know, when you're, when the trends are running the way that they're running, you know, the, the primary way that, that you're going to keep up and catch up on, on the trends that are out there is through pricing. What you're looking to do with plan design changes and trying to influence participant and client behavior on what plans they're selecting into. And other things that we're working on, the contract negotiation with United, those are designed to limit the impact of the overall cost trend. But most of it, the majority of it, is through the pricing changes."},{"end_time":"2746240","segment_id":49,"speaker":"Jim Allison","start_time":"2745680","text":"Okay."},{"end_time":"2796430","segment_id":50,"speaker":"Jim Allison","start_time":"2749920","text":"You mentioned regional differences. There's always some local and regional differences. Different carriers are stronger in different parts of the country and people have their eyes set on growth targets that may vary from state to state. The process that we look at as we're going through things is dynamic from that standpoint. But I would not say that there's a part of the country right now that is not seeing the impact of higher trends."},{"end_time":"2856090","segment_id":51,"speaker":"Paul Sarvati","start_time":"2797470","text":"Mark, I would add one more thing to what Mark, I would add one more thing to what Jim is saying, because it is important that pricing is the appropriate methodology to balance price and cost when the claim cost is what you're addressing now. The contract discussions, though, are really important because if there's anything structural that needs to be changed to handle how we're affected by these things in the future, that is really important. And that's a central element of what we're dealing with and what we're working on with UnitedHealthcare. And now it does have, once you make such a change, it can have an early term benefit to the picture that you have. But what's most important is that you are able to structure things in a way that help to mitigate against this in the future."},{"end_time":"2928280","segment_id":52,"speaker":"Mark Marcon","start_time":"2858730","text":"Really appreciate that. And then just with regards to workday, if I'm hearing things correctly or interpreting things correctly, it sounds like we'll have essentially three waves of beta. Do you think, does that mean that when we really start marketing in a broad scale to new clients or existing clients that that probably would occur more towards the fall of 2026. I'm just trying to get a sense for that. And then with regards to the expenses associated with workday, from a cash perspective, would you expect. It sounds like you're not expecting a big drop off in terms of the expenses around that because you'd still be at the relatively early stages of onboarding clients, testing things, optimizing, et cetera. So I'm just trying to understand that element as well. I appreciate any comments on those two elements."},{"end_time":"2929970","segment_id":53,"speaker":"Paul Sarvati","start_time":"2929730","text":"Sure."},{"end_time":"3042140","segment_id":54,"speaker":"Paul Sarvati","start_time":"2930050","text":"Well, first of all, on the waves, I'm not going to get out ahead of the amazing team of people that are, you know, going to great lengths to go into great detail to determine the exact times for these other two waves. I have my thoughts about it, I have my feelings about, but you know, I owe it to them to, to go through the work and to see the plan for this. Now on the other side that you're talking, even though, yes, there's costs that are going to be incurred, Jim talked a little bit about how we, when you're doing it this way, you got to muscle through the first ones. You want to make sure that the experience of these early new customers is really good. So you're going to definitely invest to make that happen. However, you know, all this investment that, you know, I'm not an accountant, in my view, a lot of this should never be going through the income statement. It's an investment for the long term of capital, but it's running through the income statement. Now there is a time when that gets mitigated through the rules. Once you have a new product that, you know is, is developed and working. So I don't know when and how that works. Jim can comment about that if he wants, but I think between the combination of revenue that we're going to have coming in, I don't know when it can be recognized either yet. So I'm not the accountant, but between revenue coming in and being able to account for it, for the expense side, I believe more appropriately, I think we have, you know, some, some nice upside coming, hopefully sooner than later."},{"end_time":"3045940","segment_id":55,"speaker":"Mark Marcon","start_time":"3045500","text":"Thank you."},{"end_time":"3121160","segment_id":56,"speaker":"Jim Allison","start_time":"3045940","text":"And if I, if I add on, if I add on to that just for a second, I would say, you know, and I've said, said this before, you know, you've got costs coming from a couple of different categories. They're clearly third party outside specifically implementation costs. You also have a pretty significant amount of costs that are related to internal resources that are working on the project. And you know, historically when they were working on projects, they, you know, likely were working on things that were capitalizable and we're not capitalizing them right now. And then there's a third part of the costs that are going on right now, which are kind of the pre build of operational expenses, onboarding and enablement teams as an example that are going to kind of transition over to working on actually setting up new customers. The difference between now and then is that we will have implementation fees that will be associated with that activity, you know, once we get into launch."},{"end_time":"3121640","segment_id":57,"speaker":"Jim Allison","start_time":"3121240","text":"So."},{"end_time":"3124440","segment_id":58,"speaker":"Mark Marcon","start_time":"3123800","text":"That helps."},{"end_time":"3134840","segment_id":59,"speaker":"OPERATOR","start_time":"3127240","text":"Thank you.

But I personally don't get too caught up in what the actual specific quarterly trend is. But what are we aiming towards on the, on the annual trend?

Now the stuff related to last year that all kind of got washed through, but when we looked at the numbers from this quarter, we said, hey, that can't be that. High end of our range is the way it came in. And so you've got to adjust for that for the balance of the year.

We've kind of gone past that to being a very solid channel partner for them and have worked toward, you know, other aspects to the relationship to where we're more aligned on doing what we can together to grow.

I would like to welcome everyone to the Insperity second quarter 2025 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. If anyone should require operator assistance during the conference, please press Star 0 on your telephone keypad. At this time I would like to introduce today's speakers. Joining us are Paul Sarvati, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Jim Allison, Executive Vice President of Finance, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. At this time I'd like to turn the call over to Jim Allison. Mr. Allison, please go ahead. Thank you. We appreciate you joining us today. Let me begin by outlining our plan for this morning's call. First, I'm going to discuss the details behind our second quarter 2025 financial results. Paul will then comment on our second quarter results, the ongoing implementation of our Workday strategic partnership, and our outlook for accelerated growth and improved profitability in 2026. I will return to provide our financial guidance for the third quarter and full year 2025. We will then end the call with a question and answer session. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that Paul or I may make forward looking statements during today's call which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. In addition, some of our discussion may include non GAAP financial measures. For a more detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, such forward looking statements and reconciliations of non GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures, please see the company's public filings, including the Form 8K filed today, which are available on our website. This morning we reported second quarter EPS of $0.26 and adjusted EBITDA of $32 million. These results fell slightly under the low end of our forecasted range by $0.03 per share and $1,000,000 respectively, primarily due to a continuation of higher than expected benefits costs. I will provide additional details in just a minute. Our unit growth was within our forecasted range with an average number of paid worksite employees increasing 0.7% over Q2 of 2024 to 309,115. Our sales force demonstrated resiliency and solid productivity in a market that continued to face many economic uncertainties. Worksite employees paid from new sales increased by 2% over Q2 of 2024, reflecting an increase in sales efficiency from a team that is smaller and more tenured than it was a year ago. Our client renewals and service teams collaborated well to produce strong client retention averaging 99% per month and in line with our prior year results. Net hiring within the client base showed some improvement throughout the quarter, slightly exceeding both our expectations and Q2 2024 levels but remaining well below historical norms. Gross profit per Worksite employee in Q2 2025 was $240 per month, down from $282 in Q2 of 2024. You may recall that Q2 2024 results were positively impacted by favorable development of healthcare claims which had totaled $25 million. In contrast, benefits costs in Q2 2025 continued to trend negatively exceeding our forecast by $12 million of this amount 8 million related to higher than expected pharmacy costs driven by higher utilization of specialty drugs such as the GLP1s and a related acceleration in the unit cost of pharmacy on a per script basis due to a change in the mix of prescriptions towards higher cost drugs. The remaining $4 million was primarily attributable to a modest increase in incurred but not reported claims that we expect to pay in the future. Based on recent claims payment patterns, we have not seen further develop deterioration in claim development related to older periods like we did in Q1 and we have seen some indications that that the previously discussed acceleration in inpatient and outpatient service utilization has moderated somewhat but remains elevated. We did see large claim frequency continue at an elevated level with cancer and heart related conditions showing the largest year over year increases. However, we have not seen signs of adverse selection among new clients as that large claim activity remains in a normal historical range as reported benefits cost per covered employee increased 9.6% year over year in Q2 and by 9% on a year to date basis. These results are skewed somewhat higher by the timing of recording favorable claims experience in the 2024 period and unfavorable claims experience in the 2025 period, but the fact remains that benefits costs continue to trend at a higher year over year rate, even slightly higher than the top end of our prior forecasted range. While this higher benefits cost trend has significantly impacted our earnings in 2025, we are executing plans designed to drive significant profitability improvement in 2026 through a careful combination of of pricing increases, plan design changes and the negotiation of the anticipated renewal of our contract with UHC. As to pricing, we have and continue to implement higher pricing targets for both new and renewing business in a strategic and methodical way. As we discussed in our Q1 call, we have been putting those bids out for a few months now and our renewal discussions with clients do not appear to have changed in any meaningful way. We expect that the impact of these pricing measures will start to accumulate during the second half of this year and continue into 2026 as expected. We continue to see clients and plan participants migrate to lower cost plan options, which is a normal response to help offset the impact of higher prices. Plan migration has historically helped to mitigate the impact of higher cost trends over time. In addition, we have determined and are in the process of implementing benefit plan design changes effective January 2026 that are designed to further mitigate future cost trend and maintain our planned competitiveness in the marketplace. Our contract extension discussions with UHC are ongoing and addressing the elevated pharmacy cost trends and the expanding use of specialty drugs is a high priority as we execute this plan. A key takeaway is that the challenges we are facing are not unique to insperity and we believe that the approach we are taking to address them are commonplace. To address current market conditions, operating expense management continues to be a keen area of focus and we have seen a company wide alignment and execution that continued to successfully manage operating expenses below budget across all expense categories while continuing to invest in our strategic priorities. On a year over year basis, operating expenses decreased by 3% with the most significant reductions in in travel, professional fees and other GNA costs. During the second quarter we invested $14 million in our Workday strategic partnership which was consistent with Q2 of 2020 2024. Our effective tax rate was impacted by the amount of non deductible expenses as a proportion of pre. During the second quarter we continued to return capital to our shareholders through a regular dividend program, paying $22 million in cash dividends. On a year to date basis, we have paid cash dividends of $45 million and repurchased 224,000 shares of stock at a cost of $19 million. We ended the quarter with $114 million of adjusted cash and we had $280 million available under our credit facility. Now at this time I'd like to turn the call over to Paul. Thank you Jim and thank you all for joining our call. Despite our reported Q2 results and the lower guidance for this year, we remain confident in our outlook for accelerated growth and improved profitability in 2026. This is due to several reasons I'll cover today, starting with the growth momentum recently achieved and the drivers we expect to continue growth acceleration over the balance of the year and into 2026. I'll also cover our updated HR Solution portfolio announced yesterday and our excellent progress on Insperity HR Scale. Our new joint offering being developed through our strategic partnership with Workday. I'll finish with the robust plan we are executing over the balance of the year and continuing into next year leading to our positive outlook. The highlight of the first half of 2025 is the resilience, agility and focus on sales and retention amid a complex and shifting market landscape. We successfully addressed the evolving uncertainty experienced by small and medium sized businesses resulting from macroeconomic tariff and policy developments in the first half of the year and challenges from stemming from specific insurance carrier publicity issues in Q2. Even though year over year growth in paid worksite employees was 0.7% in each of the first two quarters, an underlying increase of more than 3% occurred from the low point in February through the end of July. All three growth drivers including sales, client retention and net hiring with the existing client base contributed to this growth acceleration and were stronger than last year. Booked sales also showed relative strength in the face of some significant headwinds, which we accomplished with 11% fewer trained business performance advisors selling a slightly greater number of worksite employees than in the same period last year. This sales efficiency improvement of 13% in Q2 validated the sales organization changes, put in place early in the year and is encouraging as we approach the fall selling season. A key driver of these booked sales results in the quarter was our successful marketing programs that achieved our qualified lead goal and converted a solid number of leads into discovery calls and opportunities to bid for our business performance advisors. Our marketing team also completed our new product architecture and updated our HR Solutions portfolio to rebrand our flagship PEO service as Insperity HR360, our traditional employment solution as Insperity HR Core and working with our strategic partner Workday to name our joint solution appropriately Insperity HR Scale. Each solution is tailored to address specific aspects of human resource management, offering unrivaled, comprehensive support for businesses at every stage of growth and development. Together, these three premium HR solutions expand the total addressable market of SMBs and employees that can be served by Insperity. Our portfolio of add on products is dedicated to solving complex challenges for these companies and improving the lives of business owners and their employees over time. We believe that offering solutions to these clients such as our recent addition of Insperity Contractor Management powered by Wingspan and to eligible employees such as our Insperity Perks plus program may add significant revenue streams to the company or increase the stickiness of our solutions. Now I would like to focus on Insperity HR Scale and the excellent progress we have made on the way to bringing this unique solution to the marketplace. The four defined pillars of our work in the Strategic Partnership have included our Insperity Corporate Tenant, our exclusive PEO Client Tenant, our Deployment and Enablement services and our joint Go to Market Plan. Our Corporate Tenant was successfully launched earlier this year and important milestones were achieved in all 3 of our remaining major initiatives in the second quarter. Our exclusive PEO Client Tenant is the major project deliverable Embedding Workday Human Capital Management as the client facing technology into the Insperity 360 comprehensive HR service and Technology Platform to Create Insperity HR Scale we are pleased to announce today that a detailed work and testing plan developed and agreed upon by both Workday and Insperity teams have established a target Go Live date for Insperity HR Scale Beta clients early next year. This is an important step and our enablement and deployment team is ready to work with the selected Beta clients for the ramp up to the anticipated Go Live date. Although this plan is detailed, precise and very well thought out, there are remaining risks that could cause the date to move out a bit further. But in any event we have a direct line of sight to launch Insperity HR Scale. We have agreed on a plan for the Beta clients. We are actively working to define a timeline for a number of new clients and an additional group of current Insperity clients to become Insperity HR Scale clients later in 2026. I mentioned last quarter the completion of the Go to Market plan for HR Scale with Workday. Senior leadership and other key personnel from both companies agreed upon a plan and methodology to take our joint solution to the market. Together we are aligned on the target market, the product name messaging and competitive positioning, the Sales motion and most importantly, we formed a new POD or Product Oriented Delivery team focused on achieving the objectives set by the leadership of both companies. We achieved our goal of establishing this team in Q2 and began co selling discovery calls with target prospects in July. This team is focused on identifying suitable early adopter candidates, refining the appropriate sales motion and selling the first new Insperity HR Scale clients. Obviously this effort has just begun. However, in our view it's off to a very exciting start. The receptivity by prospects of the investment and commitment of Insperity and workday to a strategic partnership focused on this underserved target market has been strong and encouraging. Our market research has shown conceptual buy in by mid market companies to Insperity HR Scale which is designed to focus on affordability, ease and speed of deployment, reducing complexity and agility as companies scale One of the most exciting milestones achieved recently is the completion of the Insperity HR Scale pricing strategy provided by a leading consultancy firm. Based upon extensive market research, these results affirmed the target market's intense need for both HR services and technology and validating the premium product fit of Insperity HR Scale. This research specifically identified how components of Insperity HR Scale are valued by the target market and determined their willingness to pay at various levels. The research supports HR Scale premium pricing potential compared to historical HR360 pricing for mid market accounts. This has provided what we need to establish our initial pricing framework including upfront deployment and enablement fees, ongoing monthly HR service and technology support fees at the level exceeding our expectation, yet within the value range that we believe the target market is willing and expecting to pay. This also provided valuable information to determine a pricing roadmap to align with the Insperity HR Scale product roadmap into the future. Now let me provide some context for our growth and Profitability Outlook for 2026 based upon executing our plans for the balance of the year. This plan has three key elements including continuing growth acceleration, recovering our gross profit margin and leveraging our operating expense management trend every year. The success of our fall sales and retention campaign is pivotal to achieving the desired starting point for the coming year in paid worksite employees, setting the stage for continued growth acceleration. This year we are starting earlier, offering strong incentives and investing more to increase the likelihood and degree of success in sales and retention. We are officially launching the campaign in just a few weeks, which is approximately one month earlier than previous years. We have strong incentives for employees and prospective clients for sales and retention activity and results. We've also allocated a portion of the year to date operating expense savings to invest in in marketing opportunities. We expect to drive an increase in sales leads and opportunities. We expect to be making announcements and increasing advertising soon that will reveal significant potential return on this added investment. Another input to growth expectations is the state of the small to medium sized business community, which we believe is at an important inflection point compared to the last few years of one macroeconomic speed bump after another from inflation and interest rates and to government policy and tariffs. The recent federal legislation signed into law is validating of support for the small business community, especially on the tax and investment outlook. We believe this may play out to be a catalyst for expansion in the SMB community which could move the hiring trend back to historical levels next year. The second key element in Our game plan for the balance of the year is execution of our Gross Profit margin Recovery plan in the Healthcare Pricing and Cost framework. Jim has described three critical incentive initiatives including pricing allocations, plan design changes and our contract negotiation with our insurance carrier. All three have moved forward rapidly in the last quarter and despite the benefits cost trend being slightly worse than expected, our recovery plan is progressing along and we believe we are in a position to see improvement as we execute the recovery plan this year and heading into 2026. Another aspect of our positive outlook for next year is continuing the recent operating expense management focus to ensure operating leverage can be a part of our three year plan beginning in 2026. One key element of this plan is to continue down our AI path, which we believe can be significant in our business model. Development of our AI capabilities, as I've discussed in the past, is well underway and in use by our client facing HR professionals. Our AI focus is to improve the efficiency, value, productivity and quality of our services to the benefit of our customers and our internal operations. Our strategy is to leverage the combination of our own proprietary tool to optimize Insperity's HR and service delivery expertise with other specific AI capabilities native to platforms that we use across the company. So, in summary, we have responded well to the challenges we have faced this year to date and our plan for the balance of the year is on course toward accelerating growth and improved profitability in 2026 and beyond. At this point, I'd like to pass the call back to Jim. Thanks Paul. Now let me provide an update to our full year 2025 outlook. As Paul discussed, we have started to see some modest worksite employee growth acceleration in recent months. In addition, there are indications that clarity around tax policy has buoyed small business economic sentiment. At the same time, we remain cautious about the level of net hiring in the existing client base for the full year. We are now forecasting worksite employee growth of 1% to 2% over 2024. Given the higher benefits cost trends experienced in the first half of the year and more broadly seen in the marketplace at large, we are raising our forecasted range of benefits cost per covered employee by 75 to 100 basis points for the full year, we anticipate that the benefits cost trend will taper down from the 9% we have experienced in the first half of the year for two primary reasons. First year over year comparisons in the first half of 2025 were impacted by last year's favorable claims development and that impact should subside in the second half of the year. In addition, we continue to see favorable changes in our plan demographics and planned migration that historically have helped to favorably impact benefits Cost Trends we continue to expect that operating expenses will decline slightly sequentially in each of the remaining quarters. For the full year, we expect that operating expenses will be an overall reduction compared to 2024. This includes planned spending on the implementation of the Workday Strategic Partnership which we expect to total approximately $58 million in 2025 versus 57 million in 2024 and additional marketing spend for our fall sales campaign. For purposes of adjusted EPS, we are forecasting an effective tax rate of 29% for the full year 2025. The effective tax rate on GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhat higher and could fluctuate based on the level of non deductible expenses as a proportion of pre tax income. Based on all of these factors, we are forecasting full year adjusted EBITDA in a range of 170 million to 205 million dollars. We are forecasting full year adjusted EPS in a range of $1.81 to $2.51. As for Q3, we are forecasting the average paid worksite employees to be in a range of 312,200 to 315,300, which represents an increase of 1 to 2% over Q3 of 2024. We are forecasting adjusted EBITDA in a range of 24 to $44 million and adjusted EPS in a range of $0.06 to $0.49. As economic concerns show signs of stabilizing, business owners continue to see employee retention, engagement benefits and cost of compliance as significant concerns. We believe that these are positive trends as we approach our fall sales and client renewal season. We are executing a pricing plan and implementing plan design changes in 2026 that we believe will address the elevated benefits cost trend environment. We remain focused on operating expense management and have initiated a three year planning process to further sharpen the alignment of our sales, operating operating and development plans with our updated HR Solutions portfolio strategy as we look to drive improved profitability in 2026 and beyond. At this time, I'd like to open up the call for questions. Thank you. The floor is now open for questions.

Once again, please press Star one on your keypad at this time if you wish to join the queue to ask a question, please hold a moment while we poll for questions. And your first question this morning is coming from Andrew Nicholas, from William Blair. Andrew, your line is live. Please go ahead. Great, thank you and good morning. I wanted to first ask about workday. Appreciate all the updates there and also the new kind of branding of all the solutions. I'm just curious in terms of with the beta timing now seemingly locked in, just wondering if you could speak to maybe a line of sight for 2026 financial impact or anything on that front that you could share to give us a sense for how much could benefit profitability and growth next year. Yeah, thank you for the question, Andrew. I appreciate that and we are super excited about our progress that direction. But it's a little early to lock down and to, you know, precisely predict the actual revenue and profitability impact. You know, we are starting with the beta group that I'm really excited to announce today is has a target date early in the year. We will have, you know, our next step is to have two, what I'll call waves of additional client groups being added throughout the year. Next year a group of new clients that I'll even call new beta clients because that's kind of the way we. Need to look at that. And, and then another group of current clients that will be identified and will roll in sometime later in the year. But we also have just now received all of the information that we need for the pricing elements and that is also super important. And it was, as I mentioned in my remarks, it exceeded our expectations on how different elements are valued. Frankly, the value of the service component was even higher than expected. And the ability for the client to look at the different pieces of what we're offering and our ability to price those accordingly, including upfront fees, ongoing service fees, ongoing technology support fees, fees for adding technology elements over time. There's a lot of pieces to it. And now we are in the process and will happen over this next quarter we will lock down what would be called our, I guess I'd call it like our recommended pricing for clients at different sizes, different levels, et cetera. And then we'll be able to more closely determine what we will actually apply in pricing to these groups of clients that are being such an important part of our launch path. And obviously we will give advantages to those clients to come on. But the reality is this is validating our long term plan for really solving our success penalty of having companies grow out of our business model and having a great new avenue for New clients that are much larger coming into the company. So we'll be working on how this will be modeled in the future because I know that's an issue for you all as well. But we still have to go through some other processes to start to give some direction on that. Understood. Maybe switching gears a little bit to the WSE dynamics. Sounds like there is some progress, at least from the low point in February. I wanted to ask specifically about the net client hiring piece. Is that something that you've seen improve. Sequentially over the last couple months? Is there anything that you could say about regional or vertical dynamics there? And is there an expectation that that continues to improve over the course of the next couple quarters? Yeah. So the good news is that we, you know, have seen underlying hiring at a higher level than what has been happening now. Some of what happens this time of year is a natural summer help element and other things. But we can, in our analysis, we see that underlying there, there is movement, the right direction. It's still well below historical levels. But I also believe the confidence level we're already hearing and seeing, even post the legislation, I really feel like we're about to see a release there. Now, we haven't budgeted a lot of that in to our model going forward the balance of the year, but we do believe that things are already better out of this first half of the year. There was only one month that was somewhat of a negative. So that's good. That's moving the right direction and, and we're going to do all we can to help our customers continue to grow. Thank you. Your next question is coming from Toby Sommer from Truist. Toby, your line is live. Please go ahead. Thanks. At this juncture, do you think that. The original $150 million investment is, is still the right number? And. Do you at this juncture have better visibility into how much of that workday associated expense will go away entirely and fall back to the bottom line? So, Toby, thanks for the question. I do think that, you know, the $150 million expense, you know, when we put that out there, I think largely our focus was on the cost. Not. Only to get to go live, but to think about kind of the what was going to hit the income statement. I do think we're going to get to a point where we do see that there's going to be a product development roadmap beyond launch. But we also believe that we're going to be at a point where. Those. Expenses become capitalizable as we get closer to launch. So I would say over the five year period, the overall investment in the product is likely to continue to be a little bit over the $150 million. But I also think that the impact on the income statement will reduce pretty significantly. At the same time, I think it's important to recognize that when we move into this launch, this launch phase, the. Beta phase I would call it, you. Expect that you're going to have to muscle through. You know, some level of. Kind of working, you know, issues with the beta clients. One of the reasons you're going through this process is to make sure that you're building out, you know, very smooth processes and stuff. But we're not expecting that those are going to be, you know, perfect in that first beta launch. So we do think that from an operating cost standpoint, there's a little muscle and through that will happen in those, in those early phases and then that there will be growing operating efficiency on that front over the first several years of the launch. I appreciate that. Thank you. On the margin profile of the business, I kind of want to ask a question that will allow you to incorporate what you've learned about pricing opportunities without necessarily giving us the numbers. Paul, do you feel like at the. End of this exercise, and we can call it, you know, two years from now, three years from now, whenever we're like kind of up and humming, that the margin profile on a per worksite employee basis as well as margin profile at the corporate level on the income. Statement is better than it has been historically, the same or lower. I believe this is my opinion based on what I understand in terms of the progress we're making and even this new information we have. But I would expect it to be better. And we are literally seeing validation of the premise of this investment. And what I mean by that is obviously retention is your lowest cost new business. And that retention step up that I see from this effective execution over the next few years is going to be significant in my view. Now, in addition to that, though specific to margin, you're looking at bringing on much larger clients at pricing that is even higher than I presumed in just the penciling of the possibilities. Now, it will take a little time to ramp up to that as we. Develop the solution. But I see that happening as well. And so, like I say, it's the trifecta for our business model. It's growing the company faster in bigger chunks at a time at higher prices. That means our historical operating leverage that we've had because the technology is better, I think that ultimately enhances our business model as well. It's just at an early stage for us to lock some of that stuff down. But I appreciate the question, and I will just say that that's exactly what I see ahead and what we're working to accomplish. Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jeff Martin from Roth Capital Partners. Jeff, your line is live. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to dive in a little bit to the launch of the joint marketing here. It seems like you're going to be spending a good portion of your time and resources in 2026 on getting these beta clients launched and things smoothed out, bringing on some new clients. But how do you look at the. Joint marketing go live versus the ability to sell and turn those clients on in a timeframe? That makes sense. Yeah. So, you know, if you think about the typical scenario for a company who's having these types of needs, let me just remind you what we have validated is there's a deep need in this target marketplace for both services, HR services, having a better HR function, a strategic HR function that's really working, and the technology to help make that happen efficiently and effectively. And so if you are such a client out there today, in order to move that direction, the amount of time that it takes, the amount of investment it takes, the amount of complexity, it's all very difficult, takes a long time. And most companies have a mixed bag or a hodgepodge of components that they're trying to make all this happen. And we're bringing them a rifle to nail this down and have ultimate scalability on both the service and the technology side. Insperity. HR scale is the perfect name for this. Now, if I'm one of those prospects and I look at. Wait a minute, you're telling me that insperity and workday are totally committed, investing significantly to having this solved for me long term, hey, I want on. I want on that ship. And if it takes me, you know, even 18 months from now, that's how long it would take me. Try to do it myself and piecemeal this thing together. And it would cost more and it would be a lot harder. And I don't really have the people to make that happen myself. Anyway, I'm telling you, this is what we're seeing in the marketplace. And I'm fully. You can hear me. I'm excited about the fact that we get to. We've been talking to prospects already. They connect immediately, conceptually to having these two great companies help them solve this for the long term and, you know, to be a Part of it to get in this queue, I think is going to be a, you know, a desirable thing for these prospects now, now that we're going to be able to lock down how we can price and offer the right kind of incentives to be a part earlier, maybe part, be the early adopters. That's great. You know, that's a, that's an excellent step in addition to that. But I just believe we see the demand out there and the need, I wouldn't even call it demand because they don't know the solution's out there yet. But the need for what we're bringing to the table is clear and the value of it, perceived value of it, we believe is going to be high. So, you know, that's why being out there now, having our team already out there having these conversations and, and being able to get this on people's plate to put in their plan for the future is very appropriate. Even though we're launching the Beta group early next year. Great. And then one other here, if I could. I think you said the Salesforce BP account is down 11% year over year. Sales efficiency, you know, drove a 13%, you know, sales efficiency ratio, which is encouraging. How are you thinking about growth in the BPA base over the next, you know, 12 to 24 months as this joint solution becomes, you know, really more, more prominent in the sales effort? Yeah, I believe, you know, this is the first time that we're going to have what I would call operating leverage on the sales side of the business. We are going to grow the BPA base but nominally, you know, not near at the pace we had to in the past. Once we get this in place, you know, we're already having good success in the mid market space and this is going to enhance that and allow for us to grow the, you know, the business, the worksite employee growth, the unit growth more rapidly with fewer BPAs. So that's the game plan. There will be some growth, you know, pretty nominal for the balance of the year and into next year. But the efficiency gain that is evident is another reason why we are really ready to market more heavily and get more opportunities into the hands of these BPAs whose effectiveness is at a high level. Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mark Marcon from Baird. Mark, your line is live. Please go ahead. Good morning. I have a couple of questions. Paul and Jim, thanks a lot for all the detail. With regards to the healthcare cost, obviously everybody is seeing the same thing and facing the same pressures. I'm wondering if you have any preliminary Thoughts with regards to when you look at a combination of Plan design change versus pricing versus getting some more favorable treatment from UnitedHealthcare, how do you think of that combination and how much and specifically how much would come from plan design change and how much would come from pricing? I know it's early days and perhaps if there's any sort of regional differences, how should we think about those? And then I have a follow up with regards to workday. Yeah, thanks, Mark. Appreciate the question. What I would say is, you know, when you're, when the trends are running the way that they're running, you know, the, the primary way that, that you're going to keep up and catch up on, on the trends that are out there is through pricing. What you're looking to do with plan design changes and trying to influence participant and client behavior on what plans they're selecting into. And other things that we're working on, the contract negotiation with United, those are designed to limit the impact of the overall cost trend. But most of it, the majority of it, is through the pricing changes. Okay. You mentioned regional differences. There's always some local and regional differences. Different carriers are stronger in different parts of the country and people have their eyes set on growth targets that may vary from state to state. The process that we look at as we're going through things is dynamic from that standpoint. But I would not say that there's a part of the country right now that is not seeing the impact of higher trends. Mark, I would add one more thing to what Mark, I would add one more thing to what Jim is saying, because it is important that pricing is the appropriate methodology to balance price and cost when the claim cost is what you're addressing now. The contract discussions, though, are really important because if there's anything structural that needs to be changed to handle how we're affected by these things in the future, that is really important. And that's a central element of what we're dealing with and what we're working on with UnitedHealthcare. And now it does have, once you make such a change, it can have an early term benefit to the picture that you have. But what's most important is that you are able to structure things in a way that help to mitigate against this in the future. Really appreciate that. And then just with regards to workday, if I'm hearing things correctly or interpreting things correctly, it sounds like we'll have essentially three waves of beta. Do you think, does that mean that when we really start marketing in a broad scale to new clients or existing clients that that probably would occur more towards the fall of 2026. I'm just trying to get a sense for that. And then with regards to the expenses associated with workday, from a cash perspective, would you expect. It sounds like you're not expecting a big drop off in terms of the expenses around that because you'd still be at the relatively early stages of onboarding clients, testing things, optimizing, et cetera. So I'm just trying to understand that element as well. I appreciate any comments on those two elements. Sure. Well, first of all, on the waves, I'm not going to get out ahead of the amazing team of people that are, you know, going to great lengths to go into great detail to determine the exact times for these other two waves. I have my thoughts about it, I have my feelings about, but you know, I owe it to them to, to go through the work and to see the plan for this. Now on the other side that you're talking, even though, yes, there's costs that are going to be incurred, Jim talked a little bit about how we, when you're doing it this way, you got to muscle through the first ones. You want to make sure that the experience of these early new customers is really good. So you're going to definitely invest to make that happen. However, you know, all this investment that, you know, I'm not an accountant, in my view, a lot of this should never be going through the income statement. It's an investment for the long term of capital, but it's running through the income statement. Now there is a time when that gets mitigated through the rules. Once you have a new product that, you know is, is developed and working. So I don't know when and how that works. Jim can comment about that if he wants, but I think between the combination of revenue that we're going to have coming in, I don't know when it can be recognized either yet. So I'm not the accountant, but between revenue coming in and being able to account for it, for the expense side, I believe more appropriately, I think we have, you know, some, some nice upside coming, hopefully sooner than later. Thank you. And if I, if I add on, if I add on to that just for a second, I would say, you know, and I've said, said this before, you know, you've got costs coming from a couple of different categories. They're clearly third party outside specifically implementation costs. You also have a pretty significant amount of costs that are related to internal resources that are working on the project. And you know, historically when they were working on projects, they, you know, likely were working on things that were capitalizable and we're not capitalizing them right now. And then there's a third part of the costs that are going on right now, which are kind of the pre build of operational expenses, onboarding and enablement teams as an example that are going to kind of transition over to working on actually setting up new customers. The difference between now and then is that we will have implementation fees that will be associated with that activity, you know, once we get into launch. So. That helps. Thank you. Your next question is coming from Andrew Polkowitz from JP Morgan. Andrew, your line is live. Please go ahead. Morning Paul. Jim. And thanks for all the color. Had two questions. The first one I just wanted to ask in terms of the 3Q and 2025 outlook, what's the range of outcomes embedded from a healthcare cost trend perspective? Kind of hitting at the low and high ends of your EBITDA and EPS guidance. We have focused obviously more on where we think we're headed for the year. The year over year comparison to last year will have a lot more to do with, you know, that trajectory towards that number compared to what happened last year. So we think it's going to normalize a little bit from the 9% year to date that we've seen in the quarter or in 2025 so far. But I personally don't get too caught up in what the actual specific quarterly trend is. But what are we aiming towards on the, on the annual trend? And compared to our prior forecast, you know, we're looking at 75 to 100 basis points higher than that. Yeah, I think I would just add, if you remember a quarter ago we kind of said that the low end of our range related to kind of a continuation of the elements that were driving costs up in that first quarter. Now the stuff related to last year that all kind of got washed through, but when we looked at the numbers from this quarter, we said, hey, that can't be that. High end of our range is the way it came in. And so you've got to adjust for that for the balance of the year. And that's what we did by adding the 75 to 100 additional basis points. Okay, that's super helpful. And then my follow up question, I wanted to ask a little bit about renegotiations with UnitedHealth. Just wanted to get some color on kind of what has been the outcomes in the past. Is it really about plan design visibility or earlier visibility into data trends, price risk sharing Just wanted to kind of understand what the range of potential outcomes. For insperity can be. Thank you. Well, if I just look at the big picture of our history, and Jim has been the person in the hot seat on that front for a long time and has done a great job with UnitedHealthcare, but I would say that we've gone from, you know, being just an amazing client for them and we've seen our actual administrative expense, et cetera, and our risk charges really at really low levels for what the industry sees. We've kind of gone past that to being a very solid channel partner for them and have worked toward, you know, other aspects to the relationship to where we're more aligned on doing what we can together to grow. Now, that was, you know, interrupted with some of these, you know, the things happening in the marketplace at large. But I think that's what we're looking. To. Make sure that we've got this relationship structured where both of our incentives are aligned around what we do together and that we benefit accordingly as we grow and manage these costs going forward together. If I can add on to that. I think one of the real keys. In the middle of this is when we have discussions like that around alignment, it is very often around what is the best situation for our plan participants. You know, when we do things that are beneficial and advantageous to plan participants, not only is that a fiduciary responsibility we have, but that sets an environment that is good for us and good for UnitedHealthcare as we approach the market. Because, you know, it's no different than, than what we talk about from a cultural perspective of having a people centric approach and a customer centric approach. In this world, when we have a participant centric approach, it's good for everybody, it's good for our participants, it's good for us in the long run. It's good for UnitedHealthcare in the long run. Thank you. This does conclude our question and answer session for today. I would now like to hand the call back to Mr. Sarvati for closing remarks. Once again, we would just like to thank all of you for joining us today and we appreciate the questions and the detailed questions and we hope we have provided information for you to see why we are so excited about the future and how we're looking forward to executing a important game plan for the balance of the year and looking forward to growth, acceleration and improved profitability in 2026 and beyond. Thank you very much for participating today. Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day. Thank you once again for your participation.","transcript_id":"502b8f59-b2e4-43d0-b5aa-16f2c3150b22","type":"NON_LIVE"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-01T13:27:00Z"}],"offset":0,"status":"success","total":10505}
